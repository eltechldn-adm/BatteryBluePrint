# Leadgen & Conversion Ethics

## Soft-lock rules
- Never hide the basic result (required kWh). Always show it.
- Soft-lock only the premium extras:
  - recommended models list
  - cost ranges
  - blueprint PDF download
  - installer quote request

## Form rules
- Email capture must be clear: “We’ll email your blueprint PDF.”
- Add checkbox or clear text if sending marketing emails (optional, later).
- Keep forms short: first name + email. Location optional for quote flow.

## Conversion UX
- CTA button uses brand orange (#E35336)
- Explain the value: “Includes the math, assumptions, and shopping checklist.”
