e:T782,<p>The most common question we get isn't technical—it's practical: <em>"Is 10kWh enough?"</em></p>
<p>The answer depends entirely on <strong>why</strong> you are buying a battery.
Are you just trying to save a few pennies on evening rates?
Are you trying to keep the lights on during a 2-hour blackout?
Or are you trying to survive a 3-day grid collapse in winter?</p>
<p>These three goals require vastly different battery sizes. Let’s break down the three "Archetypes" of battery buyers and the capacity they typically need.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="archetype-1-the-bill-buster-roi-focused"><a href="#archetype-1-the-bill-buster-roi-focused">Archetype 1: The "Bill Buster" (ROI Focused)</a></h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Maximize financial savings. Buy low, sell high. Zero grid usage at peak times.
<strong>Backup Priority:</strong> Low. Used mainly for convenience.</p>
<p>If you are strictly focused on Return on Investment (ROI), <strong>smaller is better.</strong>
You want a battery that cycles 100% of its capacity every single day to tackle the "Time of Use" rates.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Size the battery to cover <em>only</em> the peak rate window (e.g., 4 PM – 9 PM).</li>
<li><strong>Typical Usage:</strong> During these 5 hours, the average efficient home might use 3–6 kWh.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended Size:</strong> 5 kWh to 10 kWh.</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> If you buy 20 kWh, you might cover the peak window and then have remaining charge left over when rates drop to "Off-Peak" cheap levels. Using stored battery power when grid power is cheap is financially inefficient.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <strong>5 - 10 kWh</strong> is usually the ROI sweet spot for most standard homes.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="archetype-2-the-resilience-user-backup-focused"><a href="#archetype-2-the-resilience-user-backup-focused">Archetype 2: The "Resilience" User (Backup Focused)</a></h2>
f:T1724,
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Keep the fridge, wifi, and lights on during occasional storms or rolling blackouts.
<strong>Backup Priority:</strong> Medium. Needs to last 12–24 hours.</p>
<p>This is the most common customer today. You aren't prepper-level, but you hate when the power goes out. You want to sleep through a blackout without the CPAP machine turning off.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Determine "Critical Loads."</li>
<li><strong>Critical Load List:</strong> Fridge (1.5 kWh/day), Wifi (0.2 kWh), LED Lights (0.5 kWh), Gas Furnace Fan (2 kWh), Minimal Kitchen use.</li>
<li><strong>Total Critical Need:</strong> ~5–7 kWh per night.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended Size:</strong> 13.5 kWh to 15 kWh (e.g., One Tesla Powerwall or equivalent).</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> A 13.5 kWh battery allows you to burn 7 kWh overnight and still wake up with 50% battery remaining—perfect buffer in case the next day is cloudy and solar recharge is slow.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <strong>13 - 15 kWh</strong> is the standard "whole home backup" size for moderate usage.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="archetype-3-the-off-grid--survivor"><a href="#archetype-3-the-off-grid--survivor">Archetype 3: The "Off-Grid" / Survivor</a></h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Total independence. Indefinite survival during long outages or completely disconnected living.
<strong>Backup Priority:</strong> Extreme. Needs to survive 3 days of bad weather (autonomy).</p>
<p>This requires a completely different mindset. You aren't sizing for "average" days; you are sizing for the <strong>Worst Case Scenario</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario:</strong> It’s December. It’s raining for 3 days straight. Solar production is near zero (10% of normal).</li>
<li><strong>Requirement:</strong> You need 3 days of "Autonomy" (Days of storage without recharge).</li>
<li><strong>Math:</strong> If you use 15 kWh/day × 3 days = 45 kWh required.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended Size:</strong> 30 kWh to 50 kWh+.</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> You need massive tanks because you cannot rely on the "pump" (solar) to refill them reliably in winter.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <strong>30 kWh+</strong> (Multiple stacked units or large server-rack banks) is required for true independence.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-usually-eats-your-capacity"><a href="#what-usually-eats-your-capacity">What Usually Eats Your Capacity?</a></h2>
<p>People overestimate how far 10 kWh goes because they forget about the "Power Hogs." If you want to run these on battery, you need to scale up—big time.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Electric Heating (Heat Pumps/Resistive):</strong> The biggest killer. A heat pump can pull 3-4 kW continuously. A 13.5 kWh battery will be dead in <strong>3 hours</strong> of heating.</li>
<li><strong>EV Charging:</strong> An electric car battery is massive (60–100 kWh). Trying to charge a car with a home battery is like trying to fill a swimming pool with a bucket. It will drain your home battery in 1 hour and only give the car ~30 miles of range.</li>
<li><strong>Electric Stoves/Ovens:</strong> Baking a turkey? That oven pulls 2-3 kW.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have these "Hogs" and want to back them up, you automatically move into <strong>Archetype 3</strong>. You need 2-3x the standard storage.</p>

<pre><code>Yes. This is a smart way to save money. You install a "Critical Loads Panel." When the grid dies, the battery *only* powers that panel (Fridge, Wifi, Lights). It disconnects the AC, Oven, and Dryer. This makes a small 10 kWh battery feel like a huge 20 kWh battery because you cut out the waste.



Technically yes, but practically no. It doesn't make sense to drain your house's emergency power just to add 10% to your car. Most smart chargers allow you to charge the EV *only* from excess solar during the day, bypassing the home battery entirely.



Start modular. Buy a system that allows expansion. Don't buy a brand that is a "closed box" integrated unit if you aren't sure. Systems like Enphase, FranklinWH, or Sol-Ark allow you to add more battery modules later without replacing the main inverter.
