e:T14a6,<p>Sizing a solar battery is the "Goldilocks" problem of renewable energy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Too Small:</strong> You run out of power at 2 AM, or you fail to capture all your solar generation, forcing you to export cheap power to the grid only to buy it back expensively later.</li>
<li><strong>Too Big:</strong> You spend thousands on capacity that sits empty because your solar panels effectively can't fill it, or sits 100% full because your house doesn't use it. It’s wasted capital.</li>
<li><strong>Just Right:</strong> The battery cycles fully every day, maximizing ROI, and provides just enough buffer to get you through cloudy days or outages.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this guide, we will walk through the <strong>manual calculation method</strong> used by solar engineers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shortcut:</strong> Don't want to do manual math? Our <a href="/calculator">Free Calculator</a> automates this entire process using local solar data for your zip code.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-3-variables-of-sizing"><a href="#the-3-variables-of-sizing">The 3 Variables of Sizing</a></h2>
<p>To size a battery, you need to balance three competing numbers. You cannot solve for one without considering the others.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Consumption:</strong> How much energy do you use at night? (Target: Self-sufficiency)</li>
<li><strong>Generation:</strong> How much <em>excess</em> solar do you produce? (Target: Charge capability)</li>
<li><strong>Backup:</strong> How long do you need to survive off-grid? (Target: Resilience)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="step-1-calculate-nightly-consumption"><a href="#step-1-calculate-nightly-consumption">Step 1: Calculate Nightly Consumption</a></h3>
<p>Your battery’s primary job is to cover the hours when the sun isn't shining.</p>
<p>If you have a Smart Meter (which most homes in the UK, California, and Texas do), look at your usage graphs.
Identify the time from <strong>Sunset (e.g., 6 PM)</strong> to <strong>Sunrise (e.g., 7 AM)</strong>.
Sum up the kWh used in that window.</p>
<p><strong>Typical Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low User:</strong> 3 - 5 kWh (Lights, fridge, TV, phone charging).</li>
<li><strong>Medium User:</strong> 8 - 12 kWh (Cooking, dishwasher, maybe a short laundry cycle).</li>
<li><strong>High User:</strong> 15 - 25+ kWh (EV charging, electric heating/AC overnight, hot tub).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rule of Thumb:</strong> Ideally, you want a battery that can cover 100% of your overnight usage so you never pull from the grid. If your nightly usage is 10 kWh, a 10 kWh battery is your <em>baseline minimum</em>.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-the-solar-fill-factor"><a href="#step-2-the-solar-fill-factor">Step 2: The Solar "Fill Factor"</a></h3>
<p>This is where most people mess up. <strong>A battery is useless if you can't fill it.</strong></p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you buy a massive 30 kWh battery bank if your solar panels only generate 5 kWh of <em>surplus</em> power during the day.</p>
<p>You need to calculate your <strong>Winter Surplus</strong>.
Why Winter? Because in Summer, you have abundant power. If you size for Summer, you will be disappointed in December. If you size for Winter (or at least Spring/Autumn), your system will be robust year-round.</p>
<p><strong>Calculation:</strong>
<code>Total Daily Solar Generation</code> - <code>Daytime Home Consumption</code> = <code>Surplus available for charging</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario:</strong> You have a 4kW solar array. In November, it generates 10 kWh total per day.</li>
<li><strong>Daytime Use:</strong> You are home, running the office and washing machine. You use 6 kWh directly.</li>
<li><strong>Surplus:</strong> 10 kWh - 6 kWh = <strong>4 kWh</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Constraint:</strong> Even if you have a 13.5 kWh Tesla Powerwall, you will only charge it to <strong>30%</strong> (4 kWh) on this day.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Engineering Advice:</strong> Do not size your battery significantly larger than your average daily export capacity. It’s generally better to undersize the battery slightly than to oversize it massively.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-depth-of-discharge-dod--buffers"><a href="#step-3-depth-of-discharge-dod--buffers">Step 3: Depth of Discharge (DoD) &#x26; Buffers</a></h3>
<p>Batteries have physical limits.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Usable Capacity:</strong> A "10 kWh" lead-acid battery might only allow you to use 50% (5 kWh) before damaging it.</li>
<li><strong>Modern Lithium (LFP):</strong> Most allow 90% to 100% DoD. A 13.5 kWh Powerwall has 13.5 kWh usable.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, for <strong>Backup Planning</strong>, you need a <strong>buffer</strong>.
If you want backup security, you never want your battery to hit 0%. You might set a "Reserve Limit" of 20%.</p>
<ul>
<li>Battery Size: 10 kWh</li>
<li>Reserve Setting: 20% (2 kWh always kept for emergencies)</li>
<li>Daily Usable: 8 kWh</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Equation:</strong>
<code>Required Capacity</code> = <code>Nightly Consumption</code> / <code>(1.0 - Reserve %)</code></p>
<p>If you need 10 kWh usable, and keep a 20% reserve:
10 / 0.8 = <strong>12.5 kWh Total Capacity Required</strong>.</p>

<p>Let's run a realistic sizing scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Profile:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Location: Austin, Texas</li>
<li>Solar System: 8 kW array</li>
<li>Daily Avg Generation: 35 kWh (Annual Avg)</li>
<li>Nightly Usage: 12 kWh</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Cover nightly usage + keep a buffer for blackouts.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Usage Target:</strong> They need 12 kWh to get through the night.</li>
<li><strong>Solar Construction Check:</strong> Their 8 kW system generates plenty of power. Even on a bad day, they likely have 15-20 kWh surplus. <strong>Generation is not the bottleneck.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Buffer:</strong> They want a 20% emergency reserve.
<ul>
<li>Target Usable: 12 kWh.</li>
<li>Math: 12 / 0.8 = 15 kWh.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hardware Selection:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Option A: 1x Tesla Powerwall 3 (13.5 kWh). <em>Verdict: Slightly too small.</em> They will hit grid power at 4 AM or have to sacrifice their reserve.</li>
<li>Option B: 1x FranklinWH (13.6 kWh). <em>Verdict: Same issue.</em></li>
<li>Option C: 2x Enphase 5P (5kWh each = 10 kWh). <em>Verdict: Way too small.</em></li>
<li>Option D: <strong>Stacking.</strong> Buying 2x Powerwalls = 27 kWh.
<ul>
<li>This gives them 12 kWh for the night + 15 kWh of massive backup reserve.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> This is the robust, "energy independent" choice, though more expensive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-modular-strategy"><a href="#the-modular-strategy">The "Modular" Strategy</a></h2>
<p>Because battery needs change (maybe you buy an EV next year), we highly recommend <strong>modular battery systems</strong>.</p>
<p>Brands like Enphase, FranklinWH, and server-rack batteries (like EG4) allow you to start small and stack more units later.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Year 1:</strong> Install 10 kWh. See how it performs.</li>
<li><strong>Year 2:</strong> Realize you need more? Add another 5 kWh module.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is safer than buying a monolithic, non-expandable system upfront.</p>

You paid for capacity you aren't using. If you have a 20 kWh battery but only use 5 kWh at night, that extra 15 kWh sits there doing nothing. It lowers your Return on Investment (ROI) significantly.



Yes. Our [Battery Blueprint Calculator](/calculator) looks at critical "Lowest Sun Month" data (usually December or January). If you size for December, you are safe for June.
