e:T9db,<p>Most people buy solar to save money. But in 2026, with grid instability rising in both the US and UK, more homeowners are buying batteries for one reason: <strong>Security.</strong></p>
<p>When the grid goes down, a standard grid-tied solar system shuts off for safety. Without a battery and a "Gateway" device to island your home, your panels are useless during a blackout.</p>
<p>But "keeping the lights on" is a vague goal. Do you mean literally just the lights? Or do you mean the AC, the well pump, and the induction cooktop?</p>
<p>This guide breaks down exactly how to size a battery for resilience, from short flickers to multi-day grid failures.</p>

<h2 id="strategy-1-the-life-support-backup-essential-loads"><a href="#strategy-1-the-life-support-backup-essential-loads">Strategy 1: The "Life Support" Backup (Essential Loads)</a></h2>
<p>This is the most cost-effective strategy. You don't back up the whole house. instead, you install a <strong>Critical Loads Panel</strong> (or use a smart span panel) to power <em>only</em> the specific circuits you need to survive.</p>
<h3 id="what-you-back-up"><a href="#what-you-back-up">What You Back Up:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fridge/Freezer:</strong> Keep food safe (1.5 kWh/day).</li>
<li><strong>Wifi Router:</strong> Communication is safety (0.2 kWh/day).</li>
<li><strong>LED Lights:</strong> Kitchen and Living Room only (0.5 kWh/day).</li>
<li><strong>Gas Furnace Fan:</strong> If you have gas heat, the fan uses very little power (2 kWh/day).</li>
<li><strong>Phone Chargers:</strong> Negligible power.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-you-drop"><a href="#what-you-drop">What You Drop:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Air Conditioning / Heat Pump (HVAC).</li>
<li>Electric Stove / Oven.</li>
<li>Electric Dryer.</li>
<li>EV Charger.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sizing-math"><a href="#sizing-math">Sizing Math</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daily Load:</strong> 5 to 7 kWh.</li>
<li><strong>Battery Size:</strong> A standard 10 to 13.5 kWh battery (like a Powerwall 3 or GivEnergy All-In-One).</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> You can survive comfortably for <strong>24 hours</strong> without sun. With solar recharge, you can likely last <strong>indefinitely</strong> provided you don't turn on the oven.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Best for 90% of homeowners. Significant protection for minimal cost.</p>

<p>This is the dream: The grid goes down, and you don't even notice. You can run the AC, bake a cake, and watch TV.</p>
<p>However, this requires massively more power (kW) and energy (kWh).</p>
<h3 id="the-surge-problem-kw"><a href="#the-surge-problem-kw">The "Surge" Problem (kW)</a></h3>
<p>The hardest part isn't keeping the fridge running—it's <strong>starting</strong> the Air Conditioner.
A central AC unit might need 4,000 Watts (4 kW) to run, but <strong>20,000 Watts (20 kW)</strong> for a split second to start the compressor. This is called "Locked Rotor Amps" (LRA).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single Battery Limit:</strong> Most batteries output only 5 kW continuous / 7 kW surge.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> If your AC tries to start, it trips the battery breaker immediately. Blackout.</li>
</ul>
<p>To run a whole home, you typically need <strong>two to three stacked batteries</strong> just to handle the startup surges of large motors.</p>
<h3 id="sizing-math-1"><a href="#sizing-math-1">Sizing Math</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daily Load:</strong> 30 to 50 kWh (Normal life usage).</li>
<li><strong>Battery Size:</strong> You need 25 to 40 kWh of storage (two or three units).</li>
<li><strong>Solar Array:</strong> You need a massive solar array (10 kW+) to refill this beast in winter.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Expensive. Only necessary if you have medical needs for HVAC or simply have the budget for total independence.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-solar-recharge-factor"><a href="#the-solar-recharge-factor">The "Solar Recharge" Factor</a></h2>
<p>A battery is just a bucket. In a multi-day outage, the size of the bucket matters less than the size of the hose filling it (Solar).</p>
<h3 id="the-winter-trap"><a href="#the-winter-trap">The Winter Trap</a></h3>
<p>Imagine a 3-day blizzard in February.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day 1:</strong> Grid fails. You drain the battery overnight.</li>
<li><strong>Day 2:</strong> Heavy clouds. Your 8 kW solar array—which typically makes 40 kWh in summer—only produces <strong>4 kWh</strong> today.</li>
<li><strong>Crisis:</strong> You used 15 kWh last night. you generated 4 kWh today. You are now in a deficit. The battery hits 0% at 8 PM, and you go dark.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Engineering Rule:</strong> For multi-day resilience, you must assume your solar production will drop by <strong>80-90%</strong> during the storm that caused the outage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you need guaranteed winter backup, do not rely solely on solar + battery. Integrating a <strong>small gas generator</strong> to recharge the batteries during "Solar Droughts" is often cheaper than buying 5 extra batteries.</p>

<pre><code>It depends on the system.
*   **UPS Grade (Uninterruptible):** Some systems (Victron, some Enphase) switch in &#x26;lt;20 milliseconds. Computers will not crash.
*   **Standard Backup:** Most systems (Tesla, FranklinWH) switch in 2-5 seconds. The lights will blink, clocks will reset, and wifi will reboot.



Technically yes, but don't.
Putting 10 kWh into your car gives you only ~35 miles of range, but it robs your house of **24 hours of survival** time. In an emergency, your house is the priority.



Yes. "Brownouts" or voltage sags can damage sensitive electronics. A good hybrid inverter acts as a power conditioner, ensuring your home gets clean 120V/240V power regardless of grid quality.

<h2 id="how-to-calculate-your-backup-needs"><a href="#how-to-calculate-your-backup-needs">How to Calculate Your Backup Needs</a></h2>
<p>Don't guess. You need to sum the wattage of every device you plan to keep running.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1:</strong> List Essentials: Fridge (150W), Wifi (20W), Lights (100W total).</li>
<li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add Heating/Cooling: Furnace Fan (400W)? Portable Heater (1500W)?</li>
<li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Calculate Hourly Load: Sum the watts / 1000 = kW usage.</li>
<li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Multiply by Hours: kW × 24 = Daily kWh needed.</li>
