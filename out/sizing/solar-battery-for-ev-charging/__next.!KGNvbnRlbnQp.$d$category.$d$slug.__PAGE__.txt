c:T993,<p>"I want a solar battery so I can charge my Tesla at night for free."</p>
<p>We hear this every day. It sounds logical: Store the sun during the day, dump it into the car at night. Free driving!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, engineering math is a cruel reality check. While <strong>charging an EV from solar</strong> is a brilliant idea, charging an EV from a <strong>home battery</strong> is often physically impossible—or financially disastrous—unless you size the system massively.</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown of the <strong>House Battery vs Car Battery</strong> mismatch.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-scale-problem-bucket-vs-swimming-pool"><a href="#the-scale-problem-bucket-vs-swimming-pool">The Scale Problem: Bucket vs Swimming Pool</a></h2>
<p>The fundamental issue is the massive difference in scale between stationary home storage and mobile automotive storage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard Home Battery:</strong> 10 kWh to 13.5 kWh.</li>
<li><strong>Standard EV Battery:</strong> 60 kWh (Model 3) to 100 kWh (Model S/Trucks).</li>
<li><strong>Daily Driving Need:</strong> ~10-15 kWh (30-40 miles).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-math-of-a-typical-night"><a href="#the-math-of-a-typical-night">The Math of a Typical Night</a></h3>
<p>Let's look at a typical scenario for a homeowner with one Powerwall (13.5 kWh).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>5 PM:</strong> Sun sets. Battery is 100% full (13.5 kWh).</li>
<li><strong>5 PM - 9 PM:</strong> House evening load. Cooking dinner, TV, lights.
<ul>
<li><strong>Usage:</strong> 4 kWh.</li>
<li><strong>Battery Remaining:</strong> 9.5 kWh.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>9 PM:</strong> You plug in the EV to charge.</li>
<li><strong>9:30 PM:</strong> The EV pulls power. Even a "slow" Level 2 charger pulls 7 kW.
<ul>
<li><strong>Duration:</strong> In just over <strong>1 hour</strong>, the car has drained the entire remaining 9.5 kWh from the house battery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>10:30 PM:</strong> House Battery is dead (0%).</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Your house goes dark (or switches to expensive grid power) for the rest of the night.</li>
<li><strong>Car Status:</strong> You only added ~30 miles of range. The car is still mostly empty.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> You emptied your entire home's reservoir to fill 15% of your car's tank.</p>

<p>The solution is not to store energy in a <em>middleman</em> box (house battery) before moving it to the car. That adds inefficiency.
The solution is to move energy <strong>directly from Solar to EV</strong>.</p>
<p>This is called <strong>Solar Excess Charging</strong> (or Zappi/Eco-Charging).</p>
<h3 id="how-it-works"><a href="#how-it-works">How It Works:</a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Smart Charger:</strong> You need a specialized EV charger (like Zappi, Wallbox, or Tesla with Solar Charge feature).</li>
<li><strong>Logic:</strong> The charger monitors your home's export.
<ul>
<li>Solar Generation = 5 kW.</li>
<li>House Load = 1 kW.</li>
<li>Export Available = 4 kW.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> The charger tells the car: <em>"Only charge at 4 kW right now."</em></li>
<li><strong>Cloud Passing:</strong> A cloud rolls over. Solar drops to 2 kw.
<ul>
<li>Export Available = 1 kW.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Adjustment:</strong> The charger instantly throttles the car down to 1 kW.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> You drive for free on 100% sunshine, without ever cycling your expensive home battery. Your home battery stays full, reserved for the house at night.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="when-does-battery-to-ev-make-sense"><a href="#when-does-battery-to-ev-make-sense">When Does "Battery-to-EV" Make Sense?</a></h2>
<p>There is one scenario where dumping a home battery into a car makes financial sense: <strong>Price Arbitrage.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Scenario:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grid Peak Rate (4-9pm):</strong> $0.50/kWh.</li>
<li><strong>Grid Off-Peak Rate (12am):</strong> $0.05/kWh.</li>
<li>You come home at 5pm with 0% charge and need to drive again at 6pm.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this emergency case, using the home battery (which filled up on free solar) to give you a quick 20 miles of range saves you from buying that $0.50/kWh peak grid power.</p>
<p>But for <strong>routine daily charging</strong>, it is almost always better to wait until midnight and charge from the cheap off-peak grid, or charge on weekends from solar excess.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="sizing-for-the-ev-dream"><a href="#sizing-for-the-ev-dream">Sizing for the "EV Dream"</a></h2>
<p>If you <em>insist</em> on charging your EV from a home battery each night (perhaps you are off-grid), you need to scale up dramatically.</p>
<p><strong>The Math for "Daily Driving" off Solar:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daily Commute:</strong> 40 miles.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Needed:</strong> ~12 kWh.</li>
<li><strong>House Nightly Usage:</strong> ~10 kWh.</li>
<li><strong>Total Battery Calculation:</strong> 22 kWh (Usable) + 20% Buffer = <strong>27 kWh</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> You need <strong>Two Powerwalls</strong> (or equivalent 25-30 kWh system).
One entire battery unit is dedicated solely to the car; the other is for the house.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="faq"><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></h2>
<pre><code>**Vehicle-to-Home (V2H)** is the holy grail. A Ford F-150 Lightning has a 130 kWh battery—equal to 10 Tesla Powerwalls.
*   **Status 2026:** It is becoming real. Enphase, Tesla, and Ford offer bidirectional chargers.
*   **The Catch:** It requires expensive proprietary hardware ($3,000+ for the bidirectional charger/gateway). But it essentially solves the whole-home backup problem instantly.



Yes and no. A home battery has a max output (e.g., 5 kW). If your EV charger tries to pull 11 kW (48 Amps), the battery will max out at 5 kW, and the grid will supply the other 6 kW. You cannot "hurt" the battery, but you will drain it in minutes.

<h2 id="summary"><a href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don't</strong> buy a standard home battery expecting to fill your EV. It's too small.</li>
<li><strong>Do</strong> buy a "Solar Smart" EV charger to soak up excess sun during the day.</li>
<li><strong>Do</strong> size up to 25-30 kWh if you are off-grid and have an EV.</li>
