Your electric vehicle contains a battery pack that's 3–10 times larger than a typical home battery. A Ford F-150 Lightning has a 131 kWh battery. A standard home battery has 10–15 kWh. The maths is obvious: if you could use your EV battery to power your home, you'd have more backup capacity than you'd ever need.

Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) technology makes this possible. It's real, it's available today on some vehicles, and it's going to become mainstream in the next 3–5 years. This guide explains how it works, what you need, and whether it changes the case for buying a separate home battery.

## What Is Vehicle-to-Home (V2H)?

V2H is a technology that allows an electric vehicle to discharge its battery to power a home. Instead of electricity flowing only from the charger into the car, it can flow in both directions — from the car into your home.

This bidirectional flow requires:
1. An EV with a bidirectional battery management system
2. A bidirectional charger (also called a V2H charger or bidirectional EVSE)
3. A home energy management system to coordinate the flow

When the grid goes down (or during expensive peak hours), the system draws power from the EV battery to power your home. When cheap electricity is available (overnight, or from solar panels), the system charges the EV battery.

## V2H vs V2G: What's the Difference?

**V2H (Vehicle-to-Home):** The EV powers your home only. Electricity flows from the car to your house but not to the wider grid.

**V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid):** The EV can export power to the wider electricity grid, not just your home. This allows the EV to participate in grid services (like a VPP) and earn money from grid operators.

**V2L (Vehicle-to-Load):** A simpler version where the EV powers individual appliances via a standard outlet, without connecting to your home's electrical system. Many EVs already offer V2L capability.

For most homeowners, V2H is the most relevant technology — it provides backup power and can reduce electricity bills without the complexity of grid connection.

## Which EVs Support V2H in 2026?

V2H capability requires specific hardware in the EV itself. Not all EVs support it. Here's the current state:

### US Market

**Ford F-150 Lightning:**
The F-150 Lightning's Intelligent Backup Power system can power a home for 3–10 days (depending on consumption and battery size). It uses Ford's Charge Station Pro (a bidirectional charger) and requires a home integration kit. This is the most capable V2H system currently available in the US.

**Ford Mustang Mach-E:**
Offers V2H capability with the Ford Charge Station Pro in some configurations.

**Rivian R1T and R1S:**
Rivian has announced V2H capability for its trucks and SUVs, with rollout ongoing.

**GM (Chevrolet, GMC, Cadillac):**
GM has announced V2H capability for its Ultium platform vehicles, including the Silverado EV and Equinox EV.

### UK and European Market

**Volkswagen ID.4, ID.5, ID.7:**
VW's ID series supports V2G (and therefore V2H) via the Bidirectional Charging Manager. Available with compatible wallboxes.

**Hyundai Ioniq 5 and 6:**
Support V2H and V2L. The Ioniq 5 can output up to 3.6 kW via V2H.

**Kia EV6:**
Supports V2H and V2L with up to 3.6 kW output.

**Nissan Leaf (older models):**
The Nissan Leaf has supported V2H in Japan since 2012 via the CHAdeMO charging standard. European and UK models with CHAdeMO support can use V2H with compatible chargers.

### Australian Market

**Nissan Leaf:**
CHAdeMO-equipped Leafs support V2H with compatible chargers.

**Hyundai Ioniq 5:**
Supports V2H and V2L.

**Kia EV6:**
Supports V2H and V2L.

**Note:** V2H availability is expanding rapidly. Check with your EV manufacturer for the latest V2H capability status for your specific model and market.

## What Equipment Do You Need?

V2H requires more than just a compatible EV. You also need:

**Bidirectional charger (V2H EVSE):**
A standard EV charger only allows electricity to flow one way (into the car). A bidirectional charger allows flow in both directions. These cost $2,000–$5,000 installed, depending on the brand and installation complexity.

Examples:
- Ford Charge Station Pro (US, for F-150 Lightning)
- Wallbox Quasar 2 (US, UK, EU — compatible with multiple EVs)
- Nissan/Nichicon V2H charger (Japan, some UK/EU models)
- Huawei LUNA2000 with V2H capability (EU, Australia)

**Home energy management system:**
A system that coordinates the flow of electricity between the EV, your home, and the grid. This may be integrated into the bidirectional charger or may be a separate device.

**Electrical panel upgrades:**
Your home's electrical panel may need upgrading to handle bidirectional power flow. This is particularly common in older homes.

**Utility approval (in some markets):**
In some jurisdictions, exporting power from your EV to the grid (V2G) requires utility approval. V2H (powering only your home) typically doesn't require utility approval, but check with your local utility.

## How Much Backup Power Does an EV Provide?

This depends on the EV's battery size and your home's energy consumption.

**Example: Ford F-150 Lightning (131 kWh battery)**
- At 20 kWh/day home consumption: 6.5 days of backup
- At 10 kWh/day home consumption: 13 days of backup
- Note: Ford recommends not discharging below 20% for vehicle use, so usable backup capacity is ~105 kWh

**Example: Hyundai Ioniq 5 (77.4 kWh battery)**
- At 20 kWh/day home consumption: ~3 days of backup
- At 10 kWh/day home consumption: ~6 days of backup
- Usable backup capacity: ~62 kWh (at 80% depth of discharge)

**Example: Nissan Leaf (40 kWh battery)**
- At 20 kWh/day home consumption: ~1.5 days of backup
- At 10 kWh/day home consumption: ~3 days of backup
- Usable backup capacity: ~32 kWh

Compare this to a typical home battery (10–15 kWh usable) and the advantage of V2H is clear for backup power.

## Does V2H Replace a Home Battery?

This is the key question. The answer depends on your situation:

**V2H may replace a home battery if:**
- You have a V2H-capable EV with a large battery (60+ kWh)
- Your EV is usually home during outages (not at work when the power goes out)
- You're primarily buying a battery for backup power, not daily energy arbitrage
- The cost of a bidirectional charger ($2,000–$5,000) is less than the cost of a home battery ($6,000–$12,000)

**V2H may not replace a home battery if:**
- Your EV is often away from home (at work, on trips) when you might need backup power
- You want daily energy arbitrage (charging cheaply, discharging during peak hours) — a home battery can do this even when your car is away
- You don't have a V2H-capable EV and aren't planning to buy one soon
- Your EV has a small battery (under 40 kWh) that limits backup duration

**The hybrid approach:**
Many homeowners will end up with both a home battery (for daily arbitrage and always-available backup) and a V2H-capable EV (for extended backup during prolonged outages). The home battery handles the day-to-day optimisation; the EV provides emergency reserve.

Use the [BatteryBlueprint calculator](/calculator) to estimate how much backup capacity you need, then compare the cost of a home battery versus a bidirectional charger for your existing or planned EV.

## The Financial Case for V2H

If you're already buying an EV, adding V2H capability costs:
- V2H-capable EV: Often no premium over non-V2H models (it's a software/hardware feature)
- Bidirectional charger: $2,000–$5,000 installed

Compare this to a home battery: $6,000–$12,000 installed for 10–15 kWh.

If your EV has a 77 kWh battery, you're getting 5× more backup capacity from the bidirectional charger than from a home battery, at a lower cost. The financial case is compelling — if your EV is usually home when you need backup power.

For daily energy arbitrage, a home battery is more reliable (it's always there) but the savings potential is similar if your EV is home during peak hours.

## FAQ

**Q: Will V2H damage my EV battery?**

V2H uses the same charge/discharge cycles as normal EV use. The additional cycling from V2H will cause some additional battery degradation over time, but the effect is typically small if V2H is used occasionally for backup rather than daily arbitrage. Check your EV manufacturer's warranty terms — some manufacturers explicitly cover V2H use, others don't.

**Q: Can I use V2H with any EV charger?**

No. V2H requires a bidirectional charger specifically designed for this purpose. Standard Level 2 chargers (the type most EV owners have at home) only charge the car — they cannot discharge it. You need to install a bidirectional charger to use V2H.

**Q: Is V2H available in my country?**

V2H is most developed in Japan (where it's been available since 2012), the US (Ford's system), and parts of Europe (Volkswagen, Hyundai, Kia). Australia is developing V2H capability. Check with your EV manufacturer and local charger suppliers for current availability.

**Q: How long does it take to install a bidirectional charger?**

Typically 4–8 hours, similar to a standard EV charger installation. If electrical panel upgrades are needed, add another 2–4 hours. The installation must be done by a licensed electrician.

**Q: Should I wait for V2H before buying a home battery?**

If you're planning to buy a V2H-capable EV in the next 1–2 years, it may be worth waiting to see how V2H works in practice before committing to a home battery. If you're not planning to buy a compatible EV, or if you need backup power now, a home battery is the right choice.
