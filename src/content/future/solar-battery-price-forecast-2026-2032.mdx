In 2010, a lithium battery cell cost around $1,200 per kilowatt-hour. In 2026, the same cell costs approximately $80–$100/kWh. That's a 93% price reduction in 16 years — one of the fastest cost declines of any technology in history.

The question every homeowner faces is: will prices keep falling? And if so, should I wait?

This guide examines the forces driving battery price declines, where prices are headed, and how to make a rational decision about timing your purchase.

## Why Battery Prices Have Fallen So Dramatically

Understanding why prices fell helps predict whether they'll continue to fall.

### Wright's Law: Learning Curves

The primary driver of battery cost reduction is **Wright's Law** (also called the learning curve or experience curve). Wright's Law states that for every doubling of cumulative production volume, costs fall by a consistent percentage.

For lithium batteries, the learning rate is approximately 18–20%. This means every time total global battery production doubles, the cost per kWh falls by 18–20%.

Global battery production has been doubling roughly every 2–3 years, driven primarily by electric vehicle adoption. This rapid scaling is the main reason battery prices have fallen so consistently.

### Manufacturing Scale

Battery manufacturing is highly capital-intensive. Large factories (gigafactories) have dramatically lower per-unit costs than smaller facilities. As more gigafactories come online — Tesla, CATL, BYD, LG Energy Solution, Panasonic — the industry's cost structure improves.

In 2026, there are over 200 GWh of annual battery manufacturing capacity globally. By 2030, this is projected to exceed 1,000 GWh — a 5× increase that will continue driving costs down.

### Raw Material Costs

Battery costs are partly determined by raw material prices — lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese. These prices are volatile and have caused temporary reversals in the long-term cost decline trend.

The shift toward LFP (lithium iron phosphate) chemistry, which uses no cobalt or nickel, has reduced raw material cost sensitivity. LFP batteries are now the dominant chemistry for residential storage and are less exposed to commodity price volatility.

### Technology Improvements

Beyond manufacturing scale, ongoing technology improvements — higher energy density, better battery management systems, improved manufacturing processes — contribute to cost reduction. These improvements are harder to predict but have historically added 2–5% per year to cost reduction beyond the learning curve effect.

## Where Prices Are Headed: 2026–2032

**Current prices (2026):**
- Battery cells: $80–$100/kWh
- Residential battery systems (installed): $600–$900/kWh
- Grid-scale battery systems (installed): $150–$200/kWh

The gap between cell cost and installed residential cost reflects inverter costs, installation labour, permitting, and installer margin. These "balance of system" costs fall more slowly than cell costs.

**2028 projections:**
- Battery cells: $60–$80/kWh
- Residential installed: $450–$650/kWh
- Grid-scale installed: $100–$150/kWh

**2030 projections:**
- Battery cells: $45–$65/kWh
- Residential installed: $350–$500/kWh
- Grid-scale installed: $80–$120/kWh

**2032 projections:**
- Battery cells: $35–$55/kWh
- Residential installed: $280–$420/kWh
- Grid-scale installed: $60–$100/kWh

These projections assume continued EV adoption driving manufacturing scale, no major supply chain disruptions, and continued technology improvement. They're broadly consistent with projections from BloombergNEF, Wood Mackenzie, and IRENA.

## What Could Slow the Price Decline?

Several factors could slow or temporarily reverse the price decline:

**Raw material supply constraints:** Lithium mining capacity hasn't kept pace with demand growth. Lithium prices spiked dramatically in 2021–2022 before falling back. Future supply crunches are possible, particularly if EV adoption accelerates faster than mining capacity expands.

**Manufacturing bottlenecks:** Building gigafactories takes 3–5 years. If demand grows faster than manufacturing capacity, prices could temporarily rise.

**Trade policy:** Tariffs on battery imports (particularly from China, which dominates global battery manufacturing) could raise prices in affected markets. The US Inflation Reduction Act includes domestic content requirements that may increase costs for some products.

**Solid-state battery transition:** If solid-state batteries achieve commercial scale, the transition from liquid electrolyte to solid electrolyte manufacturing could temporarily disrupt the learning curve, as new manufacturing processes are established.

## The "Buy Now vs Wait" Decision

Given that prices will continue to fall, should you wait?

This is a question of **net present value** — the value of benefits you receive now versus the value of lower costs in the future.

**The case for buying now:**
- Every year you wait is a year without backup power protection
- Every year you wait is a year without energy savings
- Incentives (particularly the US ITC at 30%) may not be available indefinitely
- Electricity prices are rising in most markets, increasing the value of stored energy

**The case for waiting:**
- Prices will be lower in 2–3 years
- Technology will be better (higher energy density, longer cycle life)
- V2H capability from EVs may reduce or eliminate the need for a separate battery

**The break-even analysis:**

If a 10 kWh battery costs $8,000 today and saves you $800/year, the payback period is 10 years. If you wait 3 years and the same battery costs $6,000 (25% cheaper), you've saved $2,000 on hardware but missed 3 years of $800 savings ($2,400). You're $400 worse off for waiting.

If the battery saves you $1,200/year (higher electricity prices, better tariff), the 3-year savings are $3,600 — making waiting even less attractive.

Use the [BatteryBlueprint calculator](/calculator) to estimate your annual savings. If your payback period is under 8 years at current prices, buying now is almost certainly the right decision. If your payback period is over 12 years, waiting for lower prices might make sense.

## The Impact of Falling Prices on Second-Hand Battery Values

As new battery prices fall, the resale value of existing batteries will decline. A battery you buy today for $8,000 might be worth $3,000–$4,000 in 5 years — not because it's worn out, but because new batteries are cheaper.

This doesn't change the financial case for buying (you're buying for the energy savings, not the resale value), but it's worth understanding if you're planning to sell your home. A battery installed today will likely add less to your home's value in 2030 than it does in 2026.

## What Falling Prices Mean for Grid-Scale Storage

The most dramatic impact of falling battery prices is at grid scale. At $80–$100/kWh, grid-scale batteries are already cost-competitive with gas peaker plants in many markets. At $60/kWh (projected by 2030), they'll be cheaper than virtually any alternative for grid balancing.

This has profound implications for the electricity system:
- Renewable energy becomes fully dispatchable (stored when the sun shines, released when needed)
- Gas peaker plants become uneconomic
- Electricity prices become less volatile (batteries smooth out peaks)
- The value of home battery arbitrage may decline as grid-scale storage reduces peak/off-peak price differentials

For home battery owners, this means the financial case for arbitrage may weaken over time, while the backup power value remains constant. Our [is solar battery storage worth it](/cost/is-solar-battery-storage-worth-it) guide analyses the financial case in detail.

## FAQ

**Q: Will battery prices fall by 50% in the next 5 years?**

A 50% reduction in 5 years is possible but at the high end of projections. Most analysts project 30–40% reductions in installed residential costs by 2030. Cell costs may fall faster, but balance-of-system costs (inverter, installation, permitting) fall more slowly.

**Q: Should I wait for cheaper batteries if I'm planning to buy an EV?**

If you're buying an EV with V2H capability, you may not need a separate home battery at all — or you may need a much smaller one. In this case, waiting until after your EV purchase makes sense. If your EV won't have V2H capability, the battery decision is independent.

**Q: Will the US ITC still be available at 30% in 2028?**

The ITC is legislated at 30% through 2032, then steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. Unless Congress extends it (which is possible but not guaranteed), the 30% rate is available through 2032. Buying before 2032 captures the maximum credit.

**Q: Are battery prices falling faster in some countries than others?**

Yes. Countries with high import tariffs on Chinese batteries (particularly the US) see slower price declines than countries with open markets (Australia, UK, EU). The US Inflation Reduction Act's domestic content requirements may also affect pricing for some products.

**Q: What's the cheapest battery available in 2026?**

The cheapest installed batteries in 2026 are typically Chinese-manufactured LFP systems available in Australia and Europe, where import tariffs are lower. In the US, domestic content requirements and tariffs make the cheapest options more expensive. Check our [cost guides](/cost/solar-battery-cost-usa-2026) for current regional pricing.

**Q: Will falling battery prices make solar panels cheaper too?**

Solar panel prices have already fallen dramatically — by over 90% since 2010 — and continue to decline, though more slowly than in previous years. Battery prices are now falling faster than panel prices. The combined cost of a solar+battery system has fallen significantly and will continue to fall. If you're planning a combined solar+battery installation, the financial case improves every year you wait — but so does the opportunity cost of not having the system generating savings.

**Q: Should I buy a smaller battery now and expand later?**

This depends on whether your chosen battery is expandable. Modular batteries (like the BYD Battery-Box or Enphase IQ Battery) allow you to add capacity later. Fixed-capacity batteries (like the Tesla Powerwall) cannot be expanded — you'd need to add a second unit. If you're uncertain about your future needs (planning an EV, considering a heat pump), an expandable battery system gives you flexibility. Use the [BatteryBlueprint calculator](/calculator) to estimate your current and future capacity needs before deciding.
