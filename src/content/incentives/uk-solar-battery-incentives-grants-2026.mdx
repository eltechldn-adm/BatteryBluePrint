The UK government has significantly expanded support for home battery storage in recent years, driven by energy security concerns and net-zero targets. In 2026, UK homeowners have access to a range of incentives — from VAT exemptions to export tariffs — that can meaningfully reduce the cost of adding battery storage.

This guide covers every incentive currently available in the UK, who qualifies, and how to access them.

## VAT Exemption: The Biggest Saving for Most Homeowners

The most universally available incentive for UK homeowners is the **zero-rate VAT** on battery storage systems installed alongside solar panels.

Since April 2022, the UK government has applied a 0% VAT rate (reduced from 5%, and previously 20%) to the installation of:
- Solar panels
- Battery storage systems installed at the same time as solar panels
- Battery storage systems installed separately (as of February 2024)

**What this means in practice:**

A battery system with an installed cost of £8,000 (excluding VAT) would previously have attracted £400 in VAT at 5%. At the old 20% rate, that would have been £1,600. At 0%, you pay nothing.

For a typical 10 kWh battery installation costing £7,000–£9,000, the VAT exemption saves £350–£450 compared to the previous 5% rate, and £1,400–£1,800 compared to the old 20% rate.

**Who qualifies:**
- Any UK homeowner installing a battery storage system (with or without solar panels)
- The installation must be carried out by a VAT-registered installer
- The battery must be for domestic use

**How to access it:**
Your installer should automatically apply 0% VAT. If they're charging VAT on a domestic battery installation, ask them to confirm their understanding of the current rules. If they insist on charging VAT, consider using a different installer — this is a well-established exemption.

## Smart Export Guarantee (SEG): Getting Paid for Your Exports

If you have solar panels (or plan to add them), the **Smart Export Guarantee (SEG)** pays you for every unit of electricity you export to the grid.

The SEG replaced the old Feed-in Tariff (FiT) in January 2020. Unlike the FiT, the SEG rate is not set by the government — it's set by energy suppliers, who are required to offer at least one SEG tariff. Rates vary significantly between suppliers.

**Current SEG rates (February 2026):**
- Octopus Energy: 15p/kWh (Intelligent Octopus Flux)
- Ovo Energy: 12p/kWh
- E.ON Next: 5.5p/kWh
- British Gas: 5p/kWh
- EDF: 5.5p/kWh

*(Rates change frequently — check each supplier's current offering before signing up.)*

**How battery storage affects your SEG earnings:**

Without a battery, excess solar generation is exported to the grid as soon as it's produced. With a battery, you store that excess first and only export once the battery is full. This means you export less but use more of your own generation (which is worth more than the export rate).

The optimal strategy is to:
1. Use solar generation directly in your home
2. Store excess in the battery
3. Export only when the battery is full

This maximises the value of your solar generation by using it at retail electricity prices rather than exporting at lower SEG rates.

**Who qualifies for SEG:**
- You must have a solar system with a capacity of 5 MW or less (all residential systems qualify)
- You must have a smart meter installed
- You must apply to an energy supplier that offers SEG tariffs

**How to apply:**
Contact your energy supplier or switch to one offering a competitive SEG rate. The application process is straightforward — you'll need to provide your solar system details and MCS certificate.

## ECO4 Scheme: Support for Low-Income Households

The **Energy Company Obligation (ECO4)** scheme provides free or heavily subsidised energy efficiency improvements — including battery storage in some cases — to low-income and vulnerable households.

ECO4 runs until March 2026 (with a successor scheme expected). It's funded by energy suppliers and delivered through approved installers.

**Who qualifies:**
- Households receiving certain means-tested benefits (Universal Credit, Pension Credit, Child Tax Credit, etc.)
- Households with a low EPC (Energy Performance Certificate) rating
- Some households in fuel poverty

**What's available:**
ECO4 primarily covers insulation, heat pumps, and heating systems. Battery storage is not always included, but some local authorities have used ECO4 funding to include solar+storage packages for qualifying households.

**How to check eligibility:**
Visit the government's ECO4 eligibility checker at gov.uk, or contact your energy supplier directly. Local authorities sometimes have additional funding available — check your council's website.

## Local Authority and Regional Schemes

Beyond national schemes, many UK local authorities and devolved governments offer additional incentives:

**Scotland:**
- The Home Energy Scotland scheme offers interest-free loans of up to £15,000 for energy efficiency improvements, including battery storage
- Some local authorities offer additional grants for rural properties

**Wales:**
- The Nest scheme provides free energy efficiency improvements to qualifying low-income households
- The Optimised Retrofit Programme has included battery storage in some pilot projects

**Northern Ireland:**
- The Affordable Warmth scheme provides grants for energy efficiency improvements
- Battery storage eligibility varies — check with the Housing Executive

**England (local schemes):**
- Many local authorities have used UK Shared Prosperity Fund money to offer energy efficiency grants
- Some councils have specific schemes for solar+storage in social housing

Check your local council's website and the Simple Energy Advice website (simpleenergyadvice.org.uk) for current local schemes.

## Octopus Intelligent Tariffs: The Hidden Incentive

While not a government incentive, **smart electricity tariffs** from suppliers like Octopus Energy represent a significant financial opportunity for battery owners that functions similarly to an incentive.

Octopus Intelligent Flux, for example, offers:
- Import rate as low as 7p/kWh during cheap overnight hours
- Export rate of 15p/kWh for solar exports
- Peak rate of 35p+/kWh during expensive hours

A battery owner on this tariff can charge cheaply overnight and discharge during peak hours, earning the difference. Combined with solar generation and SEG exports, the financial case for battery storage becomes very compelling.

Our [UK solar battery cost guide](/cost/solar-battery-cost-uk-2026) analyses the financial case in detail, including tariff optimisation scenarios.

## MCS Certification: Why It Matters for Incentives

The **Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS)** is the quality standard for small-scale renewable energy installations in the UK. MCS certification is required to access most UK incentives, including the SEG.

When getting quotes, always use an MCS-certified installer. You can verify an installer's MCS certification at mcscertified.com.

An MCS-certified installation will provide:
- An MCS certificate for your system
- A performance estimate
- A warranty backed by the MCS complaints process

Without MCS certification, you cannot access the SEG and may have difficulty claiming VAT exemption.

## FAQ

**Q: Is there a UK equivalent of the US Investment Tax Credit?**

No. The UK doesn't have a direct equivalent of the US ITC. The main financial incentives in the UK are the VAT exemption (saving 0% vs 20% on installation costs) and the Smart Export Guarantee (ongoing payments for solar exports). Some local schemes offer grants, but these are means-tested and geographically limited.

**Q: Can I still get the old Feed-in Tariff?**

The Feed-in Tariff closed to new applicants in April 2019. If you registered before that date, you continue to receive FiT payments for the duration of your contract (typically 20 years from registration). New solar+battery installations use the Smart Export Guarantee instead.

**Q: Do I need planning permission for a battery?**

In most cases, no. Battery storage systems installed inside or adjacent to a home are generally permitted development in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. However, there are exceptions for listed buildings, conservation areas, and some flat developments. Check with your local planning authority if you're unsure.

**Q: How do I find a reputable MCS-certified installer?**

Use the MCS installer finder at mcscertified.com. You can search by postcode and filter by technology type (battery storage). Always get at least three quotes and check reviews before committing.

**Q: Will the VAT exemption continue after 2026?**

The zero-rate VAT for energy-saving materials (including battery storage) is currently legislated to continue indefinitely. However, tax policy can change. The current exemption has strong cross-party support given the UK's net-zero commitments, making it unlikely to be reversed in the near term. For a full financial analysis of the UK battery market including current costs and payback periods, see our [UK solar battery cost guide](/cost/solar-battery-cost-uk-2026).

**Q: Can I claim the SEG if I don't have a smart meter?**

No. The Smart Export Guarantee requires a smart meter to measure your exports accurately. If you don't have a smart meter, contact your energy supplier to arrange a free installation. Smart meters are now available to virtually all UK households, and installation is free. Once your smart meter is installed, you can apply for a SEG tariff immediately.

**Q: What is the best SEG tariff in 2026?**

SEG rates change frequently as suppliers adjust their offerings. In early 2026, Octopus Energy's Intelligent Flux tariff offers among the highest export rates (around 15p/kWh during peak hours). However, the best tariff for you depends on your usage pattern, battery size, and solar generation profile. Compare current SEG rates at Ofgem's comparison tool or use a switching service that includes SEG tariffs.
