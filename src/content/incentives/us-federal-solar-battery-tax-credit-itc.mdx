The US federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) is one of the most valuable financial incentives available to homeowners adding solar battery storage. In 2026, it covers **30% of the total installed cost** of a qualifying battery system — meaning a $12,000 battery installation could reduce your federal tax bill by $3,600.

But the ITC has rules, limits, and nuances that can trip up homeowners who don't understand how it works. This guide explains everything you need to know to claim the full credit you're entitled to.

## What Is the Investment Tax Credit?

The Investment Tax Credit is a federal income tax credit that reduces the amount of federal income tax you owe, dollar for dollar. It's not a rebate (you don't get a cheque), and it's not a deduction (which only reduces your taxable income). It's a direct reduction in your tax bill.

**Example:**
- Battery installation cost: $12,000
- 30% ITC: $3,600
- Your federal tax bill before ITC: $8,000
- Your federal tax bill after ITC: $4,400

You save $3,600 in real money — as long as you owe at least $3,600 in federal income tax that year.

The ITC was extended and expanded by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, which locked in the 30% rate through 2032. After 2032, the rate is scheduled to step down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034, before expiring for residential installations in 2035 (unless Congress extends it again).

## Does the ITC Apply to Batteries?

**Yes — with an important condition.**

As of 2023, the ITC applies to standalone battery storage systems (batteries installed without solar panels) as long as the battery has a capacity of at least 3 kWh. This is a significant change from the previous rules, which required the battery to be charged primarily by solar panels.

**For batteries installed with solar panels:** The full 30% ITC applies to both the solar panels and the battery system.

**For standalone batteries (no solar):** The full 30% ITC applies to the battery system, as long as it meets the 3 kWh minimum capacity requirement. Almost all residential batteries easily exceed this threshold.

## What Costs Are Covered?

The ITC applies to the **total installed cost** of the system, which includes:

- The battery hardware (the unit itself)
- The inverter or hybrid inverter
- Mounting hardware and racking
- Electrical wiring and conduit
- Labour costs for installation
- Permit fees
- Inspection fees
- Sales tax on equipment

**What's not covered:**
- Extended warranties beyond the standard manufacturer warranty
- Monitoring subscriptions
- Ongoing maintenance contracts
- Costs for repairs to existing electrical systems that aren't directly related to the battery installation

Ask your installer to provide an itemised invoice that clearly shows all qualifying costs. This documentation is essential if the IRS ever questions your claim.

## How to Claim the ITC

The ITC is claimed on your federal income tax return using **IRS Form 5695** (Residential Energy Credits).

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Complete your battery installation** and obtain the final itemised invoice from your installer.

2. **Gather your documentation:**
   - Final invoice showing total installed cost
   - Proof of payment
   - Installer's license number and contact information
   - Battery model and specification sheet (showing ≥3 kWh capacity)

3. **Complete IRS Form 5695:**
   - Part I covers solar electric property (panels + battery)
   - Enter the total qualifying costs in the appropriate line
   - The form calculates your 30% credit automatically

4. **Transfer the credit to Form 1040:**
   - The credit amount from Form 5695 flows to Schedule 3, Line 5
   - This reduces your total federal tax liability

5. **File your return** as normal. If you use tax software (TurboTax, H&R Block, etc.), the software will guide you through Form 5695 automatically.

**Important:** Consult a qualified tax professional if you have any uncertainty about your specific situation. The IRS rules can be complex, particularly for businesses, rental properties, or unusual installation circumstances.

## What If the Credit Exceeds My Tax Liability?

This is a common concern. If your ITC credit is larger than your federal tax bill in the year of installation, you can **carry forward** the unused portion to future tax years.

**Example:**
- ITC credit: $3,600
- Federal tax liability in year of installation: $2,000
- Credit used in year 1: $2,000
- Credit carried forward to year 2: $1,600

The carryforward provision means you don't lose the credit if you can't use it all in one year. However, you do need to have sufficient tax liability over time to eventually use the full credit.

If you have very low or zero federal tax liability (for example, if you're retired with modest income), the ITC may provide limited benefit. In this case, explore state-level incentives, which may include direct rebates that don't depend on tax liability.

## State Incentives on Top of the Federal ITC

The federal ITC is just the starting point. Many states offer additional incentives that stack on top of the federal credit:

**California:** The Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) offers rebates of $150–$1,000+ per kWh for battery storage, with higher rates for low-income households and areas with high wildfire risk.

**New York:** The NY-Sun program and the NY State tax credit (25% of system cost, up to $5,000) can be combined with the federal ITC.

**Massachusetts:** The SMART program offers performance-based incentives for solar+storage systems.

**Texas:** No state income tax means no state tax credit, but some utilities offer rebates for battery storage.

**Hawaii:** The state offers a 35% state tax credit for solar systems (capped at $5,000), which stacks with the federal ITC.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Assuming you'll get a cheque.** The ITC is a tax credit, not a rebate. You need to owe federal income tax to benefit from it. If you don't owe taxes, the credit carries forward but doesn't generate a refund.

**Mistake 2: Not keeping documentation.** The IRS may ask for proof of your installation costs. Keep your invoice, proof of payment, and installer documentation for at least 7 years after filing.

**Mistake 3: Claiming the credit for ineligible costs.** Only costs directly related to the battery installation qualify. Extended warranties, monitoring subscriptions, and unrelated electrical repairs don't count.

**Mistake 4: Missing the installation deadline.** The ITC applies to systems installed and placed in service during the tax year. A battery ordered in December but not installed until January counts for the following year's taxes.

**Mistake 5: Forgetting about state incentives.** Many homeowners claim the federal ITC but miss out on state and utility rebates that could save them thousands more. Research your state's incentives before installation.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I claim the ITC if I finance my battery with a loan?**

Yes. The ITC is based on the total installed cost of the system, regardless of how you pay for it. If you take out a loan to finance the installation, you can still claim the 30% credit on the full cost.

**Q: What if I lease my battery instead of buying it?**

If you lease the battery, the leasing company (not you) owns the system and claims the ITC. You don't get the tax credit. This is one of the key reasons why purchasing (or financing) is generally more financially advantageous than leasing.

**Q: Does the ITC apply to battery replacements?**

If you replace an existing battery with a new one, the replacement battery qualifies for the ITC as long as it meets the 3 kWh minimum capacity requirement. The credit applies to the cost of the new battery and its installation.

**Q: Can businesses claim the ITC for commercial battery storage?**

Yes, businesses can claim the ITC for commercial battery storage systems. The commercial ITC has different rules and may offer additional benefits (including bonus credits for domestic content and energy communities). Consult a tax professional for commercial applications.

**Q: Is the ITC available in all US states?**

The federal ITC is available to all US taxpayers regardless of state. However, state-level incentives vary significantly. Some states have generous additional credits and rebates; others have none. Check your state's energy office website for current state-level incentives. Our [US solar battery cost guide](/cost/solar-battery-cost-usa-2026) has a state-by-state breakdown of what's available.

**Q: Can I claim the ITC if I'm self-employed or have variable income?**

Yes. The ITC is available to any US taxpayer who owes federal income tax, regardless of employment type. If you're self-employed, your federal tax liability is calculated on your net self-employment income after deductions. If your income varies year to year, the carryforward provision ensures you can use the full credit over multiple years even if your tax liability is low in the year of installation.

**Q: Does the ITC apply to battery storage in a rental property I own?**

Generally, no — the residential ITC (Form 5695) applies to your primary or secondary residence, not rental properties. However, rental properties may qualify for the commercial ITC (Investment Tax Credit for businesses), which has different rules and may offer additional benefits. Consult a tax professional if you own rental properties with battery storage.
