The "Payback Period" is the holy grail metric for solar finance.
It answers: *How long until this system has saved me enough cash to pay for its initial price tag?*

For solar panels, this is easy (usually 4–6 years).
For batteries, it is complicated.

Complex utility rates, inflation, and degradation mean a simple "back of napkin" calculation is usually wrong. Here is how to do it properly.

## The Formula

The basic formula for Simple Payback is:

`Net Cost ($)` / `Annual Savings ($)` = `Years to Payback`.

### 1. Calculating Net Cost
This is the easy part.
`Total Quote Price` - `Tax Credits/Rebates` = `Net Cost`.

*   **Example (US):** Quote is $15,000. 30% Tax Credit is $4,500.
*   **Net Cost:** $10,500.

### 2. Calculating Annual Savings (The Hard Part)
Your battery saves money in two ways:

**A. Bill Reduction (Time-of-Use Arbitrage)**
*   Scenario: Use battery power instead of Grid Power during peak hours.
*   Math: `(Peak Rate - OffPeak Rate)` × `kWh cycled per year`.
*   Example: ($0.50 - $0.10) × (10 kWh × 365 days) = **$1,460 / year**.

**B. Export Optimization (Solar Self-Consumption)**
*   Scenario: Instead of selling solar for pennies ($0.04), you store it and use it to avoid buying grid power ($0.30).
*   Math: `(Import Price - Export Price)` × `kWh stored per year`.
*   Example: ($0.30 - $0.04) × (3,000 kWh/yr) = **$780 / year**.

You need to sum A + B to get your total annual benefit.

> **Note:** You generally cannot do both A and B with the same kWh. You usually calculate one primary strategy.

## Worked Example: UK Home (High ROI)
The UK market currently offers some of the best paybacks in the world due to "Smart Tariffs" like Octopus Flux.

*   **System:** 9.5 kWh Battery (GivEnergy).
*   **Installed Cost:** £6,000 (0% VAT).
*   **Strategy:** "Force Charge" cheap electricity at night (02:00-05:00) @ 9p/kWh. Discharge during peak (16:00-19:00) avoiding 35p/kWh import.
    *   Spread: 26p per kWh.
    *   Cycle: 9.5 kWh daily.
    *   Daily Save: £2.47
*   **Annual Savings:** £2.47 × 365 = £901.
*   **Payback:** £6,000 / £901 = **6.6 Years**.
*   **After Year 6:** Pure profit for the remaining 9 years of warranty.

## Worked Example: US Home (California NEM 3.0)
California's new rules decimated solar-only value but supercharged batteries.

*   **System:** Tesla Powerwall 3.
*   **Net Cost:** $11,500 (After 30% Fed Credit).
*   **Strategy:** Avoid importing power from 4pm-9pm ($0.60/kWh summer). Store solar that would otherwise be sold for $0.04.
    *   Value created: ~$0.50 per kWh.
    *   Annual Savings: ~$1,800.
*   **Payback:** $11,500 / $1,800 = **6.4 Years**.

## The Inflation Factor: Why "Simple Payback" is Conservative

The math above assumes electricity prices stay flat for 10 years. They won't.
Utility rates historically rise 3–5% per year.
*   Year 1 Savings: $1,000.
*   Year 5 Savings: $1,200 (due to higher grid rates).
*   Year 10 Savings: $1,500.

In reality, your payback accelerates every time the utility company raises their rates. A "7 Year" simple payback is often a "5.5 Year" real-world payback when adjusted for inflation.

## FAQ

<DocsFAQ>
    <DocsFAQItem question="Does battery degradation hurt payback?">
    Yes. A battery holds less energy in Year 10 than Year 1. A robust calculation assumes the capacity drops linearly to 70% by Year 15. However, rising energy prices usually offset this loss—the battery holds less, but the energy it holds is worth more.
    </DocsFAQItem>

    <DocsFAQItem question='What is the "IRR" (Internal Rate of Return)?'>
    For financial nerds, Solar + Battery often yields an IRR of 8–12% (Tax-free). This generally beats the S&P 500 conservative estimates, making it a solid place to park cash if you plan to stay in the home.
