A solar battery is an energy storage device that captures excess electricity generated by your solar panels during the day, then releases it when you need it—at night, during cloudy weather, or when the grid goes down.

Unlike traditional grid-tied solar systems that send surplus energy back to the utility, battery-backed systems give you control over your own power supply. This means independence from rising electricity costs, protection during blackouts, and the ability to maximize the value of every kilowatt-hour your panels produce.

## How Solar Batteries Work

When your solar panels generate more electricity than your home is using, that excess power flows into your battery instead of the grid. The battery's inverter converts DC power from the panels (and battery) into AC power that your appliances can use.

Modern lithium-ion batteries like the Tesla Powerwall, LG Chem RESU, or Enphase IQ Battery use sophisticated battery management systems (BMS) to monitor charge levels, temperature, and cell health. This ensures long lifespan and safe operation across thousands of charge cycles.

Most batteries are designed for **daily cycling**—they charge during the day and discharge at night. Some homeowners also configure them for **backup mode**, where the battery reserves capacity for grid outages instead of daily use.

## Types of Solar Battery Chemistry

Not all batteries are created equal. The chemistry inside determines performance, lifespan, and suitability for different climates.

**Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP)** batteries are the most common for home energy storage. They offer excellent safety, long cycle life (6,000+ cycles), and stable performance. LFP batteries don't degrade as quickly in high temperatures and are less prone to thermal runaway compared to other lithium chemistries.

**Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC)** batteries have higher energy density, meaning you can store more energy in a smaller package. However, they typically cost more and may have slightly shorter lifespans. NMC is common in electric vehicles and some premium home battery systems.

**Lead-acid batteries** (flooded or sealed AGM/gel) are the legacy option. They're cheaper upfront but require regular maintenance, have shorter lifespans (3-5 years), and lower depth of discharge limits. Most modern solar installations avoid lead-acid unless budget is the primary constraint.

## Key Specifications to Understand

When shopping for a solar battery, you'll encounter several technical terms that determine real-world performance.

**Capacity (kWh)** is the total amount of energy the battery can store. A 10 kWh battery can theoretically power a 1 kW load for 10 hours, or a 2 kW load for 5 hours. But usable capacity is often lower due to depth of discharge limits.

**Depth of Discharge (DoD)** indicates how much of the battery's capacity you can safely use without damaging it. Modern lithium batteries typically allow 90-100% DoD, while lead-acid batteries should only be discharged to 50% to preserve lifespan.

**Round-trip efficiency** measures how much energy you get back out compared to what you put in. A battery with 90% efficiency means you lose 10% to heat and conversion losses. Most lithium batteries achieve 85-95% efficiency.

**Peak power output (kW)** determines how many high-demand appliances you can run simultaneously. A battery with 5 kW continuous power can handle typical household loads, but might struggle if you try to run an electric water heater, air conditioner, and oven at the same time.

## Why Battery Sizing Matters

Installing the wrong-sized battery is one of the most common mistakes in solar projects. Too small, and you won't have enough backup power during outages. Too large, and you're wasting money on capacity you'll never use.

The ideal battery size depends on your daily energy consumption, how many days of backup you want, and whether you're using it for daily cycling, backup-only, or both. Our [calculator](/calculator) helps you determine the right nameplate capacity based on your specific needs, accounting for efficiency losses, depth of discharge, and regional climate factors.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long do solar batteries last?**  
Most lithium-ion batteries are warrantied for 10 years or 4,000-6,000 cycles, whichever comes first. In practice, many batteries continue working well beyond their warranty period, though with gradually reduced capacity. Proper sizing, avoiding extreme temperatures, and staying within recommended discharge limits all extend lifespan.

**Q: Can I go completely off-grid with a solar battery?**  
Technically yes, but it requires significant oversizing of both your solar array and battery bank to account for seasonal variation and extended cloudy periods. Most homeowners are better served by a grid-tied system with battery backup, which gives you resilience without the complexity and cost of full off-grid independence.

**Q: Do solar batteries work during a blackout if I don't have solar panels?**  
No—solar batteries are designed to store energy from your solar panels, not to charge from the grid. If you want backup power without solar, you need a traditional battery system or standby generator. Some batteries can be configured for "time-of-use" optimization where they charge from the grid during cheap off-peak hours and discharge during expensive peak times, but this requires specific utility rate plans and compatible hardware.
