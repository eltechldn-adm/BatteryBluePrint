In 2026, the battery market has consolidated. The weak brands have vanished, and the titans are fighting purely on features and software.

We don't accept sponsorship. This list is based on **Datasheet Specs**, **Install Reliability**, and **warranty terms**.

We focus on the 4 "Tier 1" ecosystems that dominate the US and UK markets.

## 1. Tesla Powerwall 3 (The Standard)

The Apple of batteries. Ubiquitous, sleek, and high-performance.

*   **Chemistry:** LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate). *Note: Upgrade from PW2's NMC.*
*   **Capacity:** 13.5 kWh.
*   **Power Output:** 11.5 kW (Continuous). *Massive power output.*
*   **Integration:** Built-in Hybrid Solar Inverter.
*   **Best For:** New installs where you want high power to start AC units.

**Pros:**
*   Incredible 11.5 kW output eliminates the need for "soft starters" on AC units.
*   Best app interface in the industry.
*   Integrated solar inverter saves money on new installs.

**Cons:**
*   Customer service is famously difficult to reach.
*   "Walled Garden" ecosystem.

> **Winner for Power:** 11.5 kW continuous makes this the only battery that can start central AC units without soft starters.

---

## 2. FranklinWH aPower (The Retrofit King)

A favorite among electricians. It is built to be robust, generator-friendly, and chemistry-agnostic.

*   **Chemistry:** LFP.
*   **Capacity:** 13.6 kWh.
*   **Power Output:** 5 kW (Continuous) / 10 kW (Peak).
*   **Integration:** AC Coupled (Works with any solar brand).
*   **Best For:** Whole-home backup with generator integration.

**The "Gatekeeper" Architecture:**
FranklinWH's secret weapon is its "Gate" smart panel. It has a dedicated input for a **Gas Generator**.
*   **Scenario:** Grid dies. Battery drains.
*   **Action:** The Gate automatically starts your gas generator to recharge the battery and power the house, then shuts it off.
*   **Verdict:** The ultimate off-grid resilience setup.

> **Winner for Resilience:** The only battery with seamless generator integration. Critical for multi-week outages.

---

## 3. Enphase IQ Battery 5P (The Modular Choice)

Enphase dominates the microinverter market, and their battery is designed to sync perfectly with it.

*   **Chemistry:** LFP.
*   **Capacity:** 5 kWh (Modular - stack as many as you want).
*   **Power Output:** 3.84 kW (per 5kWh unit).
*   **Integration:** AC Coupled (Distributed architecture).
*   **Best For:** Current Enphase solar owners.

**Pros:**
*   **Redundancy:** If one battery unit fails, the others keep working.
*   **Burst Power:** Two 5P units (10 kWh) deliver 7.68kW continuous—very high power density.
*   **Wired Comms:** Uses wired communication, more reliable than Zigbee/WiFi.

**Cons:**
*   Expensive per kWh compared to Tesla.
*   Wall space: Mounting 4 separate units takes up a lot of garage wall.

> **Winner for Modularity:** 15-year warranty and unlimited stacking make this the most future-proof choice.

---

## 4. GivEnergy All-In-One (The UK Value Champ)

In the UK market, GivEnergy has taken the crown for value-for-money combined with excellent software.

*   **Chemistry:** LFP.
*   **Capacity:** 13.5 kWh.
*   **Power Output:** 6 kW.
*   **Integration:** AC Coupled (Retrofit friendly).
*   **Best For:** UK Homeowners wanting maximum ROI on flux tariffs.

**Pros:**
*   **Price:** Significantly cheaper than Powerwall in the UK.
*   **Software:** Open API allows hobbyists to integrate with Home Assistant easily.
*   **Support:** UK-based support team is responsive.

**Cons:**
*   Not widely available in the US market yet.
*   Heavier and bulkier unit than the Powerwall.

> **Winner for ROI:** UK pricing at £442/kWh vs £481/kWh for Tesla delivers 6-year payback.

## 5. The "Others" (Honorable Mentions)

The market is big. Here are a few others you might see on a quote.

### SolarEdge Home Battery
*   **Type:** DC Coupled (High Voltage).
*   **Verdict:** Great if you *already* love the SolarEdge ecosystem. However, SolarEdge reliability has struggled in recent years. Integration is seamless, but proprietary.

### LG Energy Solution (RESU)
*   **Type:** DC / AC options.
*   **Verdict:** They used to be the only specific alternative to Tesla. Now, they have fallen behind on software compared to Franklin and Enphase. Still solid hardware, but less "smart."

### Sonnen
*   **Type:** Luxury LFP.
*   **Verdict:** The "Mercedes" of batteries. Beautiful, expensive, but specs are often lower than Powerwall. Popular in eco-luxury builds.

---

## Buying Guide: What specs actually matter?

Ignore the marketing fluff. Look at these 3 numbers.

### 1. Continuous Power Output (kW)
This is "How many things can I run at once?"
*   **5 kW:** You can run the fridge, lights, TV, and microwave. NOT the AC.
*   **7 kW:** You can run small AC units.
*   **10 kW+:** You can run central AC and electric ovens.

### 2. Usable Capacity (kWh)
This is "How long will it last?"
*   **10 kWh:** Minimal backup (Lights/Fridge overnight).
*   **20-30 kWh:** Whole home backup for 24 hours.
*   **Rule of Thumb:** You usually need 2 batteries (26 kWh) to feel "Normal" during an outage.

### 3. Chemistry (LFP vs NMC)
*   **LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate):** Safer, longer lasting (6000+ cycles), no thermal runaway risk. **Buy this.**
*   **NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt):** Older tech (Powerwall 2). Higher energy density but lower lifespan. **Avoid unless discounted.**

## FAQ

<DocsFAQ>
    <DocsFAQItem question="Why didn't you list [Brand X]?">
    We prioritize brands with **Local Support**. There are excellent cheap batteries from China (Ruixu, EG4, Pylontech), but if they break, you are often on your own. For a home appliance, local warranty support is critical.
    </DocsFAQItem>

    <DocsFAQItem question="Can I mix battery brands?">
    No. Software doesn't play nice. Pick an ecosystem and stick to it.
    </DocsFAQItem>

    <DocsFAQItem question="Do these batteries work off-grid?">
    Yes, but some are better than others. FranklinWH and Outback Power are designed for true off-grid (no utility) living. Tesla and Enphase are designed primarily for Grid-Tied Backup (connected to utility but works when utility fails). True off-grid requires more robust generator handling.
    </DocsFAQItem>

    <DocsFAQItem question="How loud are they?">
    Powerwall 3 is fan-cooled and can hum like a fridge. Enphase 5P is passively cooled (silent). If installing near a bedroom window, check the decibel rating.
    </DocsFAQItem>

## 6. What We Would Buy (Personal Opinion)

If I were buying a battery for my own home today, here is my decision matrix:

*   **If I lived in Florida (Hurricanes):** I would buy **FranklinWH**. Period. The ability to integrate a gas generator seamlessly is non-negotiable for multi-week power outages.
*   **If I lived in California (NEM 3.0):** I would buy **Tesla Powerwall 3**. The financial math relies on perfect software arbitrage to buy/sell at the right millisecond. Tesla's software is the best at this.
*   **If I lived in the UK:** I would buy **GivEnergy**. The price point allows me to ROI in 6 years, whereas a Powerwall might take 9. Money talks.

---

## Summary Verdict

*   **The Power User:** Buy **Tesla Powerwall 3**. You cannot beat 11.5kW of power for starting central AC units.
*   **The Prepper:** Buy **FranklinWH**. The seamless generator integration is best-in-class for long outages.
*   **The Enphase Fan:** Buy **Enphase 5P**. If you have Enphase on the roof, keep the ecosystem unified for reliability.
*   **The UK Arbitrageur:** Buy **GivEnergy**. The ROI math works out far better due to lower entry cost.
