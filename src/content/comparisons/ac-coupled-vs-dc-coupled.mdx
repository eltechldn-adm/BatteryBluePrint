## 1. DC Coupled (The Hybrid Approach)

In a DC-coupled system, the solar panels and the battery share the **same inverter**.

**The Path of Electrons:**
1.  **Sun** → Panels (DC).
2.  **Charge:** DC flows directly into Battery (DC). **(No Conversion = High Efficiency).**
3.  **Use:** Battery (DC) → **Hybrid Inverter** → Home (AC).

### Pros:
*   **Efficiency:** ~98% Round-trip efficiency. You lose very little energy charging the battery because you don't convert to AC first.
*   **Simplicity:** One white box on the wall (The Hybrid Inverter) handles everything.
*   **Oversizing:** Allows you to capture "clipped" solar energy. If your inverter handles 7.6kW but your panels produce 9kW, the extra 1.4kW can flow directly into the battery instead of being lost.

### Cons:
*   **Compatibility:** If you already have an old solar inverter (e.g., SolarEdge/SMA), you basically have to rip it off the wall and replace it with a new Hybrid one. Expensive for retrofits.

**Best For:** New Installations (Solar + Battery at same time).

> **Winner for Efficiency:** 97-98% round-trip efficiency and clipping capture deliver 3-5% more annual production.

## 2. AC Coupled (The Retrofit King)

In an AC-coupled system, the battery has its *own* built-in inverter. It lives separately from your solar panels.

**The Path of Electrons:**
1.  **Sun** → Panels (DC) → **Solar Inverter** → Home (AC).
2.  **Charge:** Home (AC) → **Battery Inverter** → Battery (DC). **(Conversion Loss).**
3.  **Use:** Battery (DC) → **Battery Inverter** → Home (AC). **(Conversion Loss).**

### Pros:
*   **Flexibility:** It works with *any* existing solar system. You could have 10-year-old panels or microinverters (Enphase); the battery doesn't care. It just sees AC power in the main panel.
*   **Reliability:** If the solar inverter breaks, the battery still works (and vice versa). Redundancy.

### Cons:
*   **Efficiency:** ~90-94% Round-trip efficiency. You convert DC-AC-DC-AC. You lose energy as heat in every step.
*   **Cost:** You are paying for a second inverter inside the battery unit.

**Best For:** Retrofits (Adding battery to existing solar).
**Example:** Tesla Powerwall 2/3 (AC version), FranklinWH.

> **Winner for Flexibility:** Works with any existing solar system. No inverter replacement required.

## The Enphase Exception
Enphase systems use **Microinverters** on the roof. By definition, power comes down from the roof as AC.
Therefore, Enphase batteries (IQ 5P) are technically **AC Coupled** architecture.
*   However, they communicate so fast over the power lines that they behave like a unified system.
*   If you have Enphase Microinverters, sticking with Enphase AC batteries is usually the smartest move for software integration.

## 3. The "Clipping" Debate (Advanced)

Why do engineers love DC coupling? Because of "Clipping."

**The Scenario:**
You have 10kW of panels on the roof.
Your inverter is rated for 7.6kW (Very common ratio).
At noon in summer, your panels make 10kW. The inverter clips the output to 7.6kW. You lose 2.4kW of energy.

*   **With AC Coupling:** That 2.4kW is lost forever. Poof.
*   **With DC Coupling:** The inverter can send the 7.6kW to the home (AC) AND send the extra 2.4kW directly into the battery (DC) simultaneously. You capture 100% of the energy.
*   **Value:** This can recover ~5-10% of annual production.

## 4. Complex Scenarios: When "Rules" Break

Sometimes the standard advice fails.

**Scenario A: Microinverters + DC Battery**
Can you use Enphase microinverters (AC) with a Tesla Powerwall 3 (DC)?
*   **Yes**, but the Powerwall 3 acts as an AC coupled battery in this specific case. You lose the DC efficiency benefit, but you gain the Powerwall's high power output.

**Scenario B: Multiple Orientations**
If you have a complex roof with panels facing North, South, East, and West, microinverters (AC) are superior because they optimize each panel individually.
*   **Verdict:** Efficiency losses from shading usually outweigh DC vs AC coupling benefits. Go AC Coupled (Enphase) for complex roofs.

---

## 5. Installation Cost Difference

**Labor:**
*   **DC:** Often faster physical install (fewer boxes), but wiring high-voltage DC conduit is stiffer and more dangerous to work with.
*   **AC:** Easier wiring (standard Romex/AC wire) but more boxes to mount and commission.

**Hardware:**
*   **DC:** One Hybrid Inverter ($2,500) replaces two separate inverters ($1,500 + $1,500).
*   **Savings:** DC Coupling usually saves ~$500 - $1,000 on upfront hardware costs for new systems.

## FAQ

<DocsFAQ>
    <DocsFAQItem question="Which is cheaper?">
    DC Coupled is usually cheaper for *New* systems because you only buy one inverter.
    AC Coupled is cheaper for *Retrofit* systems because you don't have to throw away your old inverter.
    </DocsFAQItem>

    <DocsFAQItem question="Can I mix them?">
    Technically yes, but don't. Wiring a DC battery into a home that already has AC batteries creates a "Control War" where two brains try to balance the grid voltage. Stick to one ecosystem.
    </DocsFAQItem>

    <DocsFAQItem question="Does Powerwall 3 support both?">
    Yes. Currently, the **Tesla Powerwall 3** is a unique beast. It is a Hybrid Inverter (DC Coupled) by default but can be configured for AC coupling in specific setups. It marks the industry shift towards DC efficiency.
    </DocsFAQItem>

    <DocsFAQItem question="Which is better for power outages?">
    Both work fine. However, DC Coupled systems often have "Black Start" capabilities built-in more naturally. AC Coupled systems rely on frequency shifting to control the solar panels during an outage, which can sometimes cause lights to flicker or the solar to turn off if the battery is full. DC coupling modulates charge smoother.

## 6. The Retrofit Reality Check

If you already have solar, you face a tough choice.
*   **Choice A (AC Coupled):** Keep your old inverter. Add a Tesla Powerwall 2/3 or FranklinWH.
    *   **Result:** Easy install. You have two inverters. Efficiency is ~90%.
*   **Choice B (DC Coupled):** Rip out your old inverter. Install a new Hybrid Inverter + Battery.
    *   **Result:** Higher efficiency (97%). You get a fresh warranty on the inverter.
    *   **Cost:** You pay an extra $2,000 for labor to rewire the system.

**Our Advice:** Unless your old inverter is 10+ years old and about to die anyway, **stick with AC Coupling** for retrofits. The efficiency gain of DC coupling rarely pays back the labor cost of rewiring an existing working system.

## Efficiency Deep Dive: Why DC Coupling Wins on Paper

The efficiency advantage of DC coupling comes from avoiding unnecessary energy conversions.

**AC Coupling conversion chain:**
1. Solar DC → Microinverter/String Inverter (AC) [~97% efficient]
2. AC → Battery Inverter (DC for storage) [~95% efficient]
3. DC → Battery Inverter (AC for use) [~95% efficient]

**Total round-trip efficiency:** ~87%

**DC Coupling conversion chain:**
1. Solar DC → Hybrid Inverter (DC for storage) [~98% efficient]
2. DC → Hybrid Inverter (AC for use) [~97% efficient]

**Total round-trip efficiency:** ~95%

The 8% efficiency difference means that for every 10 kWh of solar energy generated, DC coupling delivers 0.8 kWh more to your home. Over a year of daily cycling, this adds up to meaningful savings.

## Real-World Considerations

### String Inverter Clipping

DC-coupled systems can capture "clipped" solar energy that string inverters would otherwise waste. When solar generation exceeds the inverter's rated capacity (e.g., a 5kW inverter with a 6kW array on a bright day), the excess is clipped. A DC-coupled battery can absorb this clipped energy directly.

This is particularly valuable in the UK where solar arrays are often oversized relative to inverter capacity to maximize winter generation.

### Retrofit Complexity

Adding a battery to an existing solar system is almost always AC-coupled because:
- The existing solar inverter stays in place (no replacement cost)
- The battery inverter is added separately
- No re-wiring of the solar array is required

The only exception is if the existing inverter is at end-of-life and needs replacement anyway—in that case, replacing it with a hybrid inverter (DC coupling) makes financial sense.

## Common Questions (FAQ)

### Can I change from AC to DC coupling later?
Yes, but it requires replacing your solar inverter with a hybrid inverter. This typically costs $2,000-$4,000 in addition to the battery cost. If you're planning to add a battery within 2-3 years, it may be worth installing a hybrid inverter now to avoid this future cost.

### Does coupling type affect backup performance?
Both AC and DC coupled systems can provide backup power during outages. However, DC-coupled systems with a hybrid inverter often have faster switchover times (milliseconds vs. seconds) because the inverter is already managing both solar and battery in a unified system.

### Which coupling is better for off-grid systems?
DC coupling is strongly preferred for off-grid systems because efficiency is critical when you have no grid backup. Every percentage point of efficiency loss means either more solar panels or more battery capacity needed. Off-grid systems almost universally use DC-coupled hybrid inverters.
