Most people buy solar to save money. But in 2026, with grid instability rising in both the US and UK, more homeowners are buying batteries for one reason: **Security.**

When the grid goes down, a standard grid-tied solar system shuts off for safety. Without a battery and a "Gateway" device to island your home, your panels are useless during a blackout.

But "keeping the lights on" is a vague goal. Do you mean literally just the lights? Or do you mean the AC, the well pump, and the induction cooktop?

This guide breaks down exactly how to size a battery for resilience, from short flickers to multi-day grid failures.

## Strategy 1: The "Life Support" Backup (Essential Loads)

This is the most cost-effective strategy. You don't back up the whole house. instead, you install a **Critical Loads Panel** (or use a smart span panel) to power *only* the specific circuits you need to survive.

### What You Back Up:
*   **Fridge/Freezer:** Keep food safe (1.5 kWh/day).
*   **Wifi Router:** Communication is safety (0.2 kWh/day).
*   **LED Lights:** Kitchen and Living Room only (0.5 kWh/day).
*   **Gas Furnace Fan:** If you have gas heat, the fan uses very little power (2 kWh/day).
*   **Phone Chargers:** Negligible power.

### What You Drop:
*   Air Conditioning / Heat Pump (HVAC).
*   Electric Stove / Oven.
*   Electric Dryer.
*   EV Charger.

### Sizing Math
*   **Daily Load:** 5 to 7 kWh.
*   **Battery Size:** A standard 10 to 13.5 kWh battery (like a Powerwall 3 or GivEnergy All-In-One).
*   **Result:** You can survive comfortably for **24 hours** without sun. With solar recharge, you can likely last **indefinitely** provided you don't turn on the oven.

**Verdict:** Best for 90% of homeowners. Significant protection for minimal cost.

## Strategy 2: Whole Home Backup (The Heavy Lift)

This is the dream: The grid goes down, and you don't even notice. You can run the AC, bake a cake, and watch TV.

However, this requires massively more power (kW) and energy (kWh).

### The "Surge" Problem (kW)
The hardest part isn't keeping the fridge running—it's **starting** the Air Conditioner.
A central AC unit might need 4,000 Watts (4 kW) to run, but **20,000 Watts (20 kW)** for a split second to start the compressor. This is called "Locked Rotor Amps" (LRA).

*   **Single Battery Limit:** Most batteries output only 5 kW continuous / 7 kW surge.
*   **Result:** If your AC tries to start, it trips the battery breaker immediately. Blackout.

To run a whole home, you typically need **two to three stacked batteries** just to handle the startup surges of large motors.

### Sizing Math
*   **Daily Load:** 30 to 50 kWh (Normal life usage).
*   **Battery Size:** You need 25 to 40 kWh of storage (two or three units).
*   **Solar Array:** You need a massive solar array (10 kW+) to refill this beast in winter.

**Verdict:** Expensive. Only necessary if you have medical needs for HVAC or simply have the budget for total independence.

## The "Solar Recharge" Factor

A battery is just a bucket. In a multi-day outage, the size of the bucket matters less than the size of the hose filling it (Solar).

### The Winter Trap
Imagine a 3-day blizzard in February.
*   **Day 1:** Grid fails. You drain the battery overnight.
*   **Day 2:** Heavy clouds. Your 8 kW solar array—which typically makes 40 kWh in summer—only produces **4 kWh** today.
*   **Crisis:** You used 15 kWh last night. you generated 4 kWh today. You are now in a deficit. The battery hits 0% at 8 PM, and you go dark.

**Engineering Rule:** For multi-day resilience, you must assume your solar production will drop by **80-90%** during the storm that caused the outage.

> **Tip:** If you need guaranteed winter backup, do not rely solely on solar + battery. Integrating a **small gas generator** to recharge the batteries during "Solar Droughts" is often cheaper than buying 5 extra batteries.

## FAQ: Outage specifics

<DocsFAQ>
    <DocsFAQItem question="Will my lights flicker when the grid fails?">
    It depends on the system.
    *   **UPS Grade (Uninterruptible):** Some systems (Victron, some Enphase) switch in &lt;20 milliseconds. Computers will not crash.
    *   **Standard Backup:** Most systems (Tesla, FranklinWH) switch in 2-5 seconds. The lights will blink, clocks will reset, and wifi will reboot.
    </DocsFAQItem>

    <DocsFAQItem question="Can I charge my EV during a blackout?">
    Technically yes, but don't.
    Putting 10 kWh into your car gives you only ~35 miles of range, but it robs your house of **24 hours of survival** time. In an emergency, your house is the priority.
    </DocsFAQItem>

    <DocsFAQItem question="Does a battery protect me from voltage sags?">
    Yes. "Brownouts" or voltage sags can damage sensitive electronics. A good hybrid inverter acts as a power conditioner, ensuring your home gets clean 120V/240V power regardless of grid quality.

## How to Calculate Your Backup Needs

Don't guess. You need to sum the wattage of every device you plan to keep running.

*   **Step 1:** List Essentials: Fridge (150W), Wifi (20W), Lights (100W total).
*   **Step 2:** Add Heating/Cooling: Furnace Fan (400W)? Portable Heater (1500W)?
*   **Step 3:** Calculate Hourly Load: Sum the watts / 1000 = kW usage.
*   **Step 4:** Multiply by Hours: kW × 24 = Daily kWh needed.

Use our calculator to do this automatically based on your appliance choices.

## Choosing the Right Battery for Backup

Not all batteries are equally suited for backup applications. Here's what to prioritize when backup power is your primary goal.

### Prioritize kW Output Over kWh Capacity

For backup use, the battery's **power output (kW)** matters as much as its capacity (kWh). A battery with 5kW output can run your fridge, lights, router, and a portable heater simultaneously. A battery with only 3kW output will trip its breaker if you try to run too many things at once.

Common backup-focused batteries and their output ratings:
- **Tesla Powerwall 3**: 11.5kW continuous, 13.5kWh capacity
- **Enphase IQ Battery 5P**: 3.84kW continuous, 5kWh capacity
- **FranklinWH aPower**: 10kW continuous, 13.6kWh capacity
- **Generac PWRcell**: 9kW continuous, 9-18kWh capacity

### Automatic vs Manual Transfer

For true backup protection, you need **automatic transfer**—the battery must detect a grid outage and switch to island mode without any human intervention. This is standard in modern hybrid inverter systems. Older AC-coupled retrofits may require manual switching, which defeats the purpose during a nighttime outage.

### Battery Monitoring During Outages

Most modern batteries include cellular or WiFi monitoring apps. During an extended outage, you can track remaining charge, estimated runtime, and current consumption from your phone. This lets you make informed decisions—like turning off the EV charger to extend backup duration by 6 hours.

## Multi-Day Outage Planning

For homeowners in areas prone to extended outages (hurricanes, ice storms, wildfire-related PSPS events), single-battery backup may not be enough. Here's how to plan for 3+ days of resilience.

### The 3-Day Rule

Emergency management agencies recommend planning for at least 72 hours of self-sufficiency. For energy, this means:

- **Essential Loads Only:** 4-6 kWh/day × 3 days = **12-18 kWh** minimum
- **Comfort Loads:** 8-12 kWh/day × 3 days = **24-36 kWh** minimum

Most single-battery systems (10-14 kWh) cover 1-2 days of essential loads. For 3-day coverage, you typically need either a large battery (25+ kWh) or a modular system with multiple units.

### Solar Recharging During Outages

If you have solar panels paired with your battery, extended outages become much more manageable. Even on a cloudy day, your panels may generate 20-40% of their rated output—enough to partially recharge the battery each day. On a sunny day, a 6kW solar array can fully recharge a 10kWh battery in 2-3 hours.

This "solar + battery" combination effectively gives you infinite backup duration as long as the sun rises each day—a significant advantage over generators that require fuel resupply.

### Generator Integration

For the most resilient setup, some homeowners combine solar + battery with a backup generator. The generator charges the battery during extended cloudy periods, while the battery provides clean, silent power for daily use. Modern hybrid inverters from brands like Sol-Ark, SMA, and Victron support generator integration natively.

## Common Questions (FAQ)

### How long will a 10kWh battery last during a power outage?
For essential loads only (fridge, lights, router, phone chargers), a 10kWh battery typically lasts 18-24 hours. If you add a gas furnace fan or small space heater, expect 12-16 hours. Running air conditioning will drain it in 4-6 hours. Use our [calculator](/calculator) to model your specific appliance list.

### Can I run my air conditioner from a battery during an outage?
Yes, but it dramatically reduces backup duration. A central AC unit draws 3-5kW continuously. A 10kWh battery would be depleted in 2-3 hours running AC alone. Most backup strategies either exclude AC or use a mini-split heat pump (more efficient) instead of central air.

### Do I need solar panels to use a battery for backup?
No. Batteries can be installed as standalone backup systems without solar panels. They charge from the grid during normal operation and discharge during outages. However, without solar, you cannot recharge during an extended grid outage—your backup duration is limited to the battery's stored capacity.

### What happens to my battery if the outage lasts longer than its capacity?
The battery will discharge to its minimum state of charge (typically 5-10%) and then stop supplying power. Your home will lose power until either the grid is restored or the battery recharges from solar. This is why sizing for your specific backup duration goal is critical—read our [battery sizing guide](/sizing/how-to-size-solar-battery-uk-us) for the full methodology.
