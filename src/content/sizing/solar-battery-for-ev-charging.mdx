"I want a solar battery so I can charge my Tesla at night for free."

We hear this every day. It sounds logical: Store the sun during the day, dump it into the car at night. Free driving!

Unfortunately, engineering math is a cruel reality check. While **charging an EV from solar** is a brilliant idea, charging an EV from a **home battery** is often physically impossible—or financially disastrous—unless you size the system massively.

Here is the breakdown of the **House Battery vs Car Battery** mismatch.

## The Scale Problem: Bucket vs Swimming Pool

The fundamental issue is the massive difference in scale between stationary home storage and mobile automotive storage.

*   **Standard Home Battery:** 10 kWh to 13.5 kWh.
*   **Standard EV Battery:** 60 kWh (Model 3) to 100 kWh (Model S/Trucks).
*   **Daily Driving Need:** ~10-15 kWh (30-40 miles).

### The Math of a Typical Night
Let's look at a typical scenario for a homeowner with one Powerwall (13.5 kWh).

1.  **5 PM:** Sun sets. Battery is 100% full (13.5 kWh).
2.  **5 PM - 9 PM:** House evening load. Cooking dinner, TV, lights.
    *   **Usage:** 4 kWh.
    *   **Battery Remaining:** 9.5 kWh.
3.  **9 PM:** You plug in the EV to charge.
4.  **9:30 PM:** The EV pulls power. Even a "slow" Level 2 charger pulls 7 kW.
    *   **Duration:** In just over **1 hour**, the car has drained the entire remaining 9.5 kWh from the house battery.
5.  **10:30 PM:** House Battery is dead (0%).
6.  **Result:** Your house goes dark (or switches to expensive grid power) for the rest of the night.
7.  **Car Status:** You only added ~30 miles of range. The car is still mostly empty.

**Conclusion:** You emptied your entire home's reservoir to fill 15% of your car's tank.

## The Right Way: "Solar Excess Charging"

The solution is not to store energy in a *middleman* box (house battery) before moving it to the car. That adds inefficiency.
The solution is to move energy **directly from Solar to EV**.

This is called **Solar Excess Charging** (or Zappi/Eco-Charging).

### How It Works:
1.  **Smart Charger:** You need a specialized EV charger (like Zappi, Wallbox, or Tesla with Solar Charge feature).
2.  **Logic:** The charger monitors your home's export.
    *   Solar Generation = 5 kW.
    *   House Load = 1 kW.
    *   Export Available = 4 kW.
3.  **Action:** The charger tells the car: *"Only charge at 4 kW right now."*
4.  **Cloud Passing:** A cloud rolls over. Solar drops to 2 kw.
    *   Export Available = 1 kW.
5.  **Adjustment:** The charger instantly throttles the car down to 1 kW.

**Result:** You drive for free on 100% sunshine, without ever cycling your expensive home battery. Your home battery stays full, reserved for the house at night.

## When Does "Battery-to-EV" Make Sense?

There is one scenario where dumping a home battery into a car makes financial sense: **Price Arbitrage.**

**The Scenario:**
*   **Grid Peak Rate (4-9pm):** $0.50/kWh.
*   **Grid Off-Peak Rate (12am):** $0.05/kWh.
*   You come home at 5pm with 0% charge and need to drive again at 6pm.

In this emergency case, using the home battery (which filled up on free solar) to give you a quick 20 miles of range saves you from buying that $0.50/kWh peak grid power.

But for **routine daily charging**, it is almost always better to wait until midnight and charge from the cheap off-peak grid, or charge on weekends from solar excess.

## Sizing for the "EV Dream"

If you *insist* on charging your EV from a home battery each night (perhaps you are off-grid), you need to scale up dramatically.

**The Math for "Daily Driving" off Solar:**
*   **Daily Commute:** 40 miles.
*   **Energy Needed:** ~12 kWh.
*   **House Nightly Usage:** ~10 kWh.
*   **Total Battery Calculation:** 22 kWh (Usable) + 20% Buffer = **27 kWh**.

**Recommendation:** You need **Two Powerwalls** (or equivalent 25-30 kWh system).
One entire battery unit is dedicated solely to the car; the other is for the house.

## FAQ

<DocsFAQ>
    <DocsFAQItem question="Can I use my EV to power my house (V2H)?">
    **Vehicle-to-Home (V2H)** is the holy grail. A Ford F-150 Lightning has a 130 kWh battery—equal to 10 Tesla Powerwalls.
    *   **Status 2026:** It is becoming real. Enphase, Tesla, and Ford offer bidirectional chargers.
    *   **The Catch:** It requires expensive proprietary hardware ($3,000+ for the bidirectional charger/gateway). But it essentially solves the whole-home backup problem instantly.
    </DocsFAQItem>

    <DocsFAQItem question="Does fast charging hurt my solar battery?">
    Yes and no. A home battery has a max output (e.g., 5 kW). If your EV charger tries to pull 11 kW (48 Amps), the battery will max out at 5 kW, and the grid will supply the other 6 kW. You cannot "hurt" the battery, but you will drain it in minutes.

## Summary

1.  **Don't** buy a standard home battery expecting to fill your EV. It's too small.
2.  **Do** buy a "Solar Smart" EV charger to soak up excess sun during the day.
3.  **Do** size up to 25-30 kWh if you are off-grid and have an EV.
