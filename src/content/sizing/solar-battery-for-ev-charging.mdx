"I want a solar battery so I can charge my Tesla at night for free."

We hear this every day. It sounds logical: Store the sun during the day, dump it into the car at night. Free driving!

Unfortunately, engineering math is a cruel reality check. While **charging an EV from solar** is a brilliant idea, charging an EV from a **home battery** is often physically impossible—or financially disastrous—unless you size the system massively.

Here is the breakdown of the **House Battery vs Car Battery** mismatch.

## The Scale Problem: Bucket vs Swimming Pool

The fundamental issue is the massive difference in scale between stationary home storage and mobile automotive storage.

*   **Standard Home Battery:** 10 kWh to 13.5 kWh.
*   **Standard EV Battery:** 60 kWh (Model 3) to 100 kWh (Model S/Trucks).
*   **Daily Driving Need:** ~10-15 kWh (30-40 miles).

### The Math of a Typical Night
Let's look at a typical scenario for a homeowner with one Powerwall (13.5 kWh).

1.  **5 PM:** Sun sets. Battery is 100% full (13.5 kWh).
2.  **5 PM - 9 PM:** House evening load. Cooking dinner, TV, lights.
    *   **Usage:** 4 kWh.
    *   **Battery Remaining:** 9.5 kWh.
3.  **9 PM:** You plug in the EV to charge.
4.  **9:30 PM:** The EV pulls power. Even a "slow" Level 2 charger pulls 7 kW.
    *   **Duration:** In just over **1 hour**, the car has drained the entire remaining 9.5 kWh from the house battery.
5.  **10:30 PM:** House Battery is dead (0%).
6.  **Result:** Your house goes dark (or switches to expensive grid power) for the rest of the night.
7.  **Car Status:** You only added ~30 miles of range. The car is still mostly empty.

**Conclusion:** You emptied your entire home's reservoir to fill 15% of your car's tank.

## The Right Way: "Solar Excess Charging"

The solution is not to store energy in a *middleman* box (house battery) before moving it to the car. That adds inefficiency.
The solution is to move energy **directly from Solar to EV**.

This is called **Solar Excess Charging** (or Zappi/Eco-Charging).

### How It Works:
1.  **Smart Charger:** You need a specialized EV charger (like Zappi, Wallbox, or Tesla with Solar Charge feature).
2.  **Logic:** The charger monitors your home's export.
    *   Solar Generation = 5 kW.
    *   House Load = 1 kW.
    *   Export Available = 4 kW.
3.  **Action:** The charger tells the car: *"Only charge at 4 kW right now."*
4.  **Cloud Passing:** A cloud rolls over. Solar drops to 2 kw.
    *   Export Available = 1 kW.
5.  **Adjustment:** The charger instantly throttles the car down to 1 kW.

**Result:** You drive for free on 100% sunshine, without ever cycling your expensive home battery. Your home battery stays full, reserved for the house at night.

## When Does "Battery-to-EV" Make Sense?

There is one scenario where dumping a home battery into a car makes financial sense: **Price Arbitrage.**

**The Scenario:**
*   **Grid Peak Rate (4-9pm):** $0.50/kWh.
*   **Grid Off-Peak Rate (12am):** $0.05/kWh.
*   You come home at 5pm with 0% charge and need to drive again at 6pm.

In this emergency case, using the home battery (which filled up on free solar) to give you a quick 20 miles of range saves you from buying that $0.50/kWh peak grid power.

But for **routine daily charging**, it is almost always better to wait until midnight and charge from the cheap off-peak grid, or charge on weekends from solar excess.

## Sizing for the "EV Dream"

If you *insist* on charging your EV from a home battery each night (perhaps you are off-grid), you need to scale up dramatically.

**The Math for "Daily Driving" off Solar:**
*   **Daily Commute:** 40 miles.
*   **Energy Needed:** ~12 kWh.
*   **House Nightly Usage:** ~10 kWh.
*   **Total Battery Calculation:** 22 kWh (Usable) + 20% Buffer = **27 kWh**.

**Recommendation:** You need **Two Powerwalls** (or equivalent 25-30 kWh system).
One entire battery unit is dedicated solely to the car; the other is for the house.

## FAQ

<DocsFAQ>
    <DocsFAQItem question="Can I use my EV to power my house (V2H)?">
    **Vehicle-to-Home (V2H)** is the holy grail. A Ford F-150 Lightning has a 130 kWh battery—equal to 10 Tesla Powerwalls.
    *   **Status 2026:** It is becoming real. Enphase, Tesla, and Ford offer bidirectional chargers.
    *   **The Catch:** It requires expensive proprietary hardware ($3,000+ for the bidirectional charger/gateway). But it essentially solves the whole-home backup problem instantly.
    </DocsFAQItem>

    <DocsFAQItem question="Does fast charging hurt my solar battery?">
    Yes and no. A home battery has a max output (e.g., 5 kW). If your EV charger tries to pull 11 kW (48 Amps), the battery will max out at 5 kW, and the grid will supply the other 6 kW. You cannot "hurt" the battery, but you will drain it in minutes.

## Summary

1.  **Don't** buy a standard home battery expecting to fill your EV. It's too small.
2.  **Do** buy a "Solar Smart" EV charger to soak up excess sun during the day.
3.  **Do** size up to 25-30 kWh if you are off-grid and have an EV.

## The Smart Approach: Solar-Direct EV Charging

The correct way to charge an EV from solar is to bypass the home battery entirely and charge the car **directly from excess solar generation** during the day.

This is called **solar-direct** or **solar-matched** charging, and it works like this:

1. Your solar panels generate power during the day.
2. Your home uses what it needs.
3. **Excess solar** flows to a smart EV charger instead of the battery or grid.
4. The EV charger dynamically adjusts its charging rate to match available solar surplus.
5. The home battery charges from any remaining surplus after the EV is satisfied.

This approach avoids the round-trip efficiency loss of storing energy in the home battery and then transferring it to the EV. It also doesn't deplete your backup reserve.

### Smart EV Chargers That Support Solar-Direct Charging

- **Zappi (UK)**: The most popular solar-aware charger in the UK. Modes include Eco (supplements solar with grid) and Eco+ (solar-only, minimum 1.4kW).
- **Wallbox Pulsar Plus**: Supports solar integration via API with compatible inverters.
- **Tesla Wall Connector**: Integrates natively with Tesla Powerwall and solar systems.
- **Ohme Home Pro (UK)**: Smart tariff-aware charging that can also respond to solar generation.

## Sizing a System for EV Charging

If you're committed to charging your EV from stored solar energy (perhaps for overnight charging), here's how to size the system correctly.

### Step 1: Calculate Your Daily EV Energy Requirement

Most EVs use approximately 3-4 miles per kWh. For a typical commuter driving 40 miles/day:

- **Energy needed:** 40 miles ÷ 3.5 miles/kWh = **11.4 kWh/day**

This is in addition to your home's overnight consumption (typically 5-12 kWh for a UK/US home).

### Step 2: Total Daily Storage Requirement

- **Home overnight use:** 8 kWh
- **EV charging:** 11.4 kWh
- **Total:** 19.4 kWh
- **With 20% buffer:** **24.3 kWh**

This is why EV + battery systems typically require 25-30 kWh of storage—nearly double what a non-EV home needs.

### Step 3: Solar Array Sizing

To fill a 25kWh battery from solar alone, you need a substantial array. In a location with 4 peak sun hours/day:

- **Required solar:** 25 kWh ÷ 4 hours = **6.25 kW minimum**
- **Recommended:** 8-10 kW to account for losses and winter generation

## Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)

An emerging technology flips the equation entirely: instead of charging your EV from a home battery, your **EV charges your home**.

**Vehicle-to-Home (V2H)** allows bidirectional charging—your EV battery (typically 60-100kWh) can power your home during an outage or peak hours. This is 4-7x more storage than a typical home battery at no additional cost.

**Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)** extends this to selling power back to the grid during peak demand, earning revenue from your EV battery.

Currently supported vehicles include the Nissan Leaf (with CHAdeMO), Ford F-150 Lightning, and several Hyundai/Kia models. Tesla does not currently support V2H/V2G, though this may change.

For homes with V2H-capable EVs, the case for a separate home battery becomes much weaker—your car IS the battery.

## Common Questions (FAQ)

### Can I charge my Tesla from a Powerwall?
Yes, but it's inefficient. The Powerwall stores 13.5kWh. A Tesla Model 3 needs about 15kWh for 60 miles of range. You'd drain the entire Powerwall and still not fully charge the car. The math only works if you have multiple Powerwalls or a very short daily commute.

### What is the minimum solar array size for EV + home battery?
For a typical home with an EV driving 40 miles/day, you need at least 8-10kW of solar and 20-25kWh of battery storage. Anything smaller will result in significant grid imports, especially in winter.

### Does fast charging hurt my solar battery?
Yes and no. A home battery has a max output (e.g., 5 kW). If your EV charger tries to pull 11 kW (48 Amps), the battery will max out at 5 kW, and the grid will supply the other 6 kW. You cannot "hurt" the battery, but you will drain it in minutes.

### Is V2H worth waiting for?
If you're buying a new EV in the next 1-2 years, check for V2H compatibility. A V2H-capable EV effectively gives you 60-100kWh of home backup storage at no additional cost beyond the bidirectional charger (~£1,500-£3,000). For many homeowners, this eliminates the need for a separate home battery entirely.
