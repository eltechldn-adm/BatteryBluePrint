Sizing a solar battery is the "Goldilocks" problem of renewable energy.

*   **Too Small:** You run out of power at 2 AM, or you fail to capture all your solar generation, forcing you to export cheap power to the grid only to buy it back expensively later.
*   **Too Big:** You spend thousands on capacity that sits empty because your solar panels effectively can't fill it, or sits 100% full because your house doesn't use it. It’s wasted capital.
*   **Just Right:** The battery cycles fully every day, maximizing ROI, and provides just enough buffer to get you through cloudy days or outages.

In this guide, we will walk through the **manual calculation method** used by solar engineers.

## The 3 Variables of Sizing

To size a battery, you need to balance three competing numbers. You cannot solve for one without considering the others.

1.  **Consumption:** How much energy do you use at night? (Target: Self-sufficiency)
2.  **Generation:** How much *excess* solar do you produce? (Target: Charge capability)
3.  **Backup:** How long do you need to survive off-grid? (Target: Resilience)

### Step 1: Calculate Nightly Consumption

Your battery’s primary job is to cover the hours when the sun isn't shining.

If you have a Smart Meter (which most homes in the UK, California, and Texas do), look at your usage graphs.
Identify the time from **Sunset (e.g., 6 PM)** to **Sunrise (e.g., 7 AM)**.
Sum up the kWh used in that window.

**Typical Examples:**
*   **Low User:** 3 - 5 kWh (Lights, fridge, TV, phone charging).
*   **Medium User:** 8 - 12 kWh (Cooking, dishwasher, maybe a short laundry cycle).
*   **High User:** 15 - 25+ kWh (EV charging, electric heating/AC overnight, hot tub).

**Rule of Thumb:** Ideally, you want a battery that can cover 100% of your overnight usage so you never pull from the grid. If your nightly usage is 10 kWh, a 10 kWh battery is your *baseline minimum*.

### Step 2: The Solar "Fill Factor"

This is where most people mess up. **A battery is useless if you can't fill it.**

It doesn't matter if you buy a massive 30 kWh battery bank if your solar panels only generate 5 kWh of *surplus* power during the day.

You need to calculate your **Winter Surplus**.
Why Winter? Because in Summer, you have abundant power. If you size for Summer, you will be disappointed in December. If you size for Winter (or at least Spring/Autumn), your system will be robust year-round.

**Calculation:**
`Total Daily Solar Generation` - `Daytime Home Consumption` = `Surplus available for charging`.

*   **Scenario:** You have a 4kW solar array. In November, it generates 10 kWh total per day.
*   **Daytime Use:** You are home, running the office and washing machine. You use 6 kWh directly.
*   **Surplus:** 10 kWh - 6 kWh = **4 kWh**.
*   **Constraint:** Even if you have a 13.5 kWh Tesla Powerwall, you will only charge it to **30%** (4 kWh) on this day.

**Engineering Advice:** Do not size your battery significantly larger than your average daily export capacity. It’s generally better to undersize the battery slightly than to oversize it massively.

### Step 3: Depth of Discharge (DoD) & Buffers

Batteries have physical limits.
*   **Usable Capacity:** A "10 kWh" lead-acid battery might only allow you to use 50% (5 kWh) before damaging it.
*   **Modern Lithium (LFP):** Most allow 90% to 100% DoD. A 13.5 kWh Powerwall has 13.5 kWh usable.

However, for **Backup Planning**, you need a **buffer**.
If you want backup security, you never want your battery to hit 0%. You might set a "Reserve Limit" of 20%.
*   Battery Size: 10 kWh
*   Reserve Setting: 20% (2 kWh always kept for emergencies)
*   Daily Usable: 8 kWh

**Equation:**
`Required Capacity` = `Nightly Consumption` / `(1.0 - Reserve %)`

If you need 10 kWh usable, and keep a 20% reserve:
10 / 0.8 = **12.5 kWh Total Capacity Required**.

## Worked Example: The "Smith" Family

Let's run a realistic sizing scenario.

**Profile:**
*   Location: Austin, Texas
*   Solar System: 8 kW array
*   Daily Avg Generation: 35 kWh (Annual Avg)
*   Nightly Usage: 12 kWh

**Goal:** Cover nightly usage + keep a buffer for blackouts.

1.  **Usage Target:** They need 12 kWh to get through the night.
2.  **Solar Construction Check:** Their 8 kW system generates plenty of power. Even on a bad day, they likely have 15-20 kWh surplus. **Generation is not the bottleneck.**
3.  **Buffer:** They want a 20% emergency reserve.
    *   Target Usable: 12 kWh.
    *   Math: 12 / 0.8 = 15 kWh.
4.  **Hardware Selection:**
    *   Option A: 1x Tesla Powerwall 3 (13.5 kWh). *Verdict: Slightly too small.* They will hit grid power at 4 AM or have to sacrifice their reserve.
    *   Option B: 1x FranklinWH (13.6 kWh). *Verdict: Same issue.*
    *   Option C: 2x Enphase 5P (5kWh each = 10 kWh). *Verdict: Way too small.*
    *   Option D: **Stacking.** Buying 2x Powerwalls = 27 kWh.
        *   This gives them 12 kWh for the night + 15 kWh of massive backup reserve.
        *   **Result:** This is the robust, "energy independent" choice, though more expensive.

## The "Modular" Strategy

Because battery needs change (maybe you buy an EV next year), we highly recommend **modular battery systems**.

Brands like Enphase, FranklinWH, and server-rack batteries (like EG4) allow you to start small and stack more units later.
*   **Year 1:** Install 10 kWh. See how it performs.
*   **Year 2:** Realize you need more? Add another 5 kWh module.

This is safer than buying a monolithic, non-expandable system upfront.

## FAQ

<DocsFAQ>
    <DocsFAQItem question="What happens if I undersize my battery?">
    You will simply pull from the grid earlier in the morning. It’s not catastrophic. From a financial ROI perspective, slightly undersizing is actually *better* because every electron in the battery gets used every single night. You get 100% utilization.
    </DocsFAQItem>

    <DocsFAQItem question="What happens if I oversize my battery?">
    You paid for capacity you aren't using. If you have a 20 kWh battery but only use 5 kWh at night, that extra 15 kWh sits there doing nothing. It lowers your Return on Investment (ROI) significantly.
    </DocsFAQItem>

    <DocsFAQItem question="Does the calculator account for winter?">
    Yes. Our [Battery Blueprint Calculator](/calculator) looks at critical "Lowest Sun Month" data (usually December or January). If you size for December, you are safe for June.

## Summary Checklist

1.  Determined nightly kWh usage?
2.  Confirmed solar array is big enough to fill that capacity in Winter?
3.  Added a 20% buffer for blackouts/resilience?
4.  Checked the Peak Power (kW) output (see our [kW vs kWh guide](/basics/kwh-explained))?

If you have those four numbers, you are ready to shop.

**Next Step:** Skip the manual math. Use our algorithm to run this simulation for your specific zip code and roof angle.

## Advanced Sizing: Accounting for Degradation

Batteries lose capacity over time. A 10kWh battery in Year 1 may only deliver 8kWh in Year 10. If you're sizing for a 10-year horizon, factor in this degradation.

Most LFP batteries are warranted to retain 70% capacity after 10 years (or 6,000 cycles). For long-term planning:

- **Year 1 capacity:** 10kWh
- **Year 10 capacity:** ~7kWh (70% retention)
- **Sizing recommendation:** If you need 10kWh usable in Year 10, buy a 14.3kWh battery today (10 / 0.7)

This is especially important for off-grid systems where the battery must meet your full load requirements throughout its lifespan.

## Sizing for Time-of-Use Tariffs

If your primary goal is financial optimization rather than backup, the sizing logic changes. You want to store enough energy to cover your entire **peak tariff window**.

For example, on Octopus Agile (UK) or PG&E TOU-D (US), peak rates typically run from 4 PM to 9 PM (5 hours). If your home uses 2kW during this period:

- **Peak period consumption:** 2kW × 5 hours = 10kWh
- **Minimum battery size:** 10kWh (to avoid any peak grid imports)
- **With 20% buffer:** 12.5kWh

For TOU optimization, the battery doesn't need to cover overnight consumption—just the expensive peak window. This often results in a smaller optimal battery size than backup-focused sizing.

## UK vs US Sizing Differences

The optimal battery size differs between UK and US homes due to different consumption patterns and grid structures.

**UK homes** typically use 8-10 kWh/day total, with lower overnight consumption (3-5 kWh). The UK's variable smart tariffs (Octopus Agile, Flux) reward batteries that can respond to real-time pricing. Most UK homes are well-served by a 5-10kWh battery.

**US homes** use significantly more energy (25-30 kWh/day average), with higher overnight consumption (8-15 kWh). US homes also tend to have more high-power appliances (central AC, electric dryers, pool pumps). Most US homes need 10-20kWh for meaningful self-sufficiency.

## Common Questions (FAQ)

### What happens if I undersize my battery?
You will simply pull from the grid earlier in the morning. It's not catastrophic. From a financial ROI perspective, slightly undersizing is actually *better* because every electron in the battery gets used every single night. You get 100% utilization.

### What happens if I oversize my battery?
You paid for capacity you aren't using. If you have a 20 kWh battery but only use 5 kWh at night, that extra 15 kWh sits there doing nothing. It lowers your Return on Investment (ROI) significantly.

### Does the calculator account for winter?
Yes. Our [Battery Blueprint Calculator](/calculator) looks at critical "Lowest Sun Month" data (usually December or January). If you size for December, you are safe for June.

### How does battery sizing change if I add an EV?
Adding an EV dramatically increases your sizing requirements. A typical EV needs 10-15 kWh per 40 miles of daily driving. The most efficient approach is to charge the EV directly from solar during the day, bypassing the home battery entirely. This avoids double conversion losses and preserves your backup reserve.

### Should I size for today's usage or future usage?
Size for your expected usage in 2-3 years, not just today. If you're planning to add an EV, heat pump, or electric cooking in the near future, factor those loads in now. It's much cheaper to buy the right-sized inverter upfront than to replace it later.
