The most common question we get isn't technical—it's practical: *"Is 10kWh enough?"*

The answer depends entirely on **why** you are buying a battery.
Are you just trying to save a few pennies on evening rates?
Are you trying to keep the lights on during a 2-hour blackout?
Or are you trying to survive a 3-day grid collapse in winter?

These three goals require vastly different battery sizes. Let’s break down the three "Archetypes" of battery buyers and the capacity they typically need.

---

## Archetype 1: The "Bill Buster" (ROI Focused)
**Goal:** Maximize financial savings. Buy low, sell high. Zero grid usage at peak times.
**Backup Priority:** Low. Used mainly for convenience.

If you are strictly focused on Return on Investment (ROI), **smaller is better.**
You want a battery that cycles 100% of its capacity every single day to tackle the "Time of Use" rates.

*   **Strategy:** Size the battery to cover *only* the peak rate window (e.g., 4 PM – 9 PM).
*   **Typical Usage:** During these 5 hours, the average efficient home might use 3–6 kWh.
*   **Recommended Size:** 5 kWh to 10 kWh.
*   **Why?** If you buy 20 kWh, you might cover the peak window and then have remaining charge left over when rates drop to "Off-Peak" cheap levels. Using stored battery power when grid power is cheap is financially inefficient.

**Verdict:** **5 - 10 kWh** is usually the ROI sweet spot for most standard homes.

---

## Archetype 2: The "Resilience" User (Backup Focused)
**Goal:** Keep the fridge, wifi, and lights on during occasional storms or rolling blackouts.
**Backup Priority:** Medium. Needs to last 12–24 hours.

This is the most common customer today. You aren't prepper-level, but you hate when the power goes out. You want to sleep through a blackout without the CPAP machine turning off.

*   **Strategy:** Determine "Critical Loads."
*   **Critical Load List:** Fridge (1.5 kWh/day), Wifi (0.2 kWh), LED Lights (0.5 kWh), Gas Furnace Fan (2 kWh), Minimal Kitchen use.
*   **Total Critical Need:** ~5–7 kWh per night.
*   **Recommended Size:** 13.5 kWh to 15 kWh (e.g., One Tesla Powerwall or equivalent).
*   **Why?** A 13.5 kWh battery allows you to burn 7 kWh overnight and still wake up with 50% battery remaining—perfect buffer in case the next day is cloudy and solar recharge is slow.

**Verdict:** **13 - 15 kWh** is the standard "whole home backup" size for moderate usage.

---

## Archetype 3: The "Off-Grid" / Survivor
**Goal:** Total independence. Indefinite survival during long outages or completely disconnected living.
**Backup Priority:** Extreme. Needs to survive 3 days of bad weather (autonomy).

This requires a completely different mindset. You aren't sizing for "average" days; you are sizing for the **Worst Case Scenario**.

*   **Scenario:** It’s December. It’s raining for 3 days straight. Solar production is near zero (10% of normal).
*   **Requirement:** You need 3 days of "Autonomy" (Days of storage without recharge).
*   **Math:** If you use 15 kWh/day × 3 days = 45 kWh required.
*   **Recommended Size:** 30 kWh to 50 kWh+.
*   **Why?** You need massive tanks because you cannot rely on the "pump" (solar) to refill them reliably in winter.

**Verdict:** **30 kWh+** (Multiple stacked units or large server-rack banks) is required for true independence.

## What Usually Eats Your Capacity?

People overestimate how far 10 kWh goes because they forget about the "Power Hogs." If you want to run these on battery, you need to scale up—big time.

1.  **Electric Heating (Heat Pumps/Resistive):** The biggest killer. A heat pump can pull 3-4 kW continuously. A 13.5 kWh battery will be dead in **3 hours** of heating.
2.  **EV Charging:** An electric car battery is massive (60–100 kWh). Trying to charge a car with a home battery is like trying to fill a swimming pool with a bucket. It will drain your home battery in 1 hour and only give the car ~30 miles of range.
3.  **Electric Stoves/Ovens:** Baking a turkey? That oven pulls 2-3 kW.

If you have these "Hogs" and want to back them up, you automatically move into **Archetype 3**. You need 2-3x the standard storage.

## Rules of Thumb by Home Size

While manual calculation is best, here are general averages we see in the field (USA/UK Standards):

| Home Size | ROI Focus (kWh) | Backup Focus (kWh) | Off-Grid Focus (kWh) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Small Appt / Condo** | 3.6 - 5 kWh | 5 - 10 kWh | 15+ kWh |
| **Average 3-Bed Home** | 5 - 10 kWh | 10 - 15 kWh | 30+ kWh |
| **Large Family Home** | 10 - 15 kWh | 20 - 27 kWh | 50+ kWh |
| **Large + EV + Heat Pump** | 15 - 20 kWh | 30 - 40 kWh | 80+ kWh |

## FAQ

<DocsFAQ>
    <DocsFAQItem question='Can I settle for "Critical Load" backup?'>
    Yes. This is a smart way to save money. You install a "Critical Loads Panel." When the grid dies, the battery *only* powers that panel (Fridge, Wifi, Lights). It disconnects the AC, Oven, and Dryer. This makes a small 10 kWh battery feel like a huge 20 kWh battery because you cut out the waste.
    </DocsFAQItem>

    <DocsFAQItem question="Can't I just charge my EV from the battery?">
    Technically yes, but practically no. It doesn't make sense to drain your house's emergency power just to add 10% to your car. Most smart chargers allow you to charge the EV *only* from excess solar during the day, bypassing the home battery entirely.
    </DocsFAQItem>

    <DocsFAQItem question="What if I get it wrong?">
    Start modular. Buy a system that allows expansion. Don't buy a brand that is a "closed box" integrated unit if you aren't sure. Systems like Enphase, FranklinWH, or Sol-Ark allow you to add more battery modules later without replacing the main inverter.

## Calculate Your Exact Number

Charts and averages are helpful, but your home is unique.
A 2,000 sq ft home in Arizona needs different storage than a 2,000 sq ft home in Maine.

Use our calculator to input your specific appliances and location. We'll tell you which Archetype you fit into and exactly how many kWh you need.

## The Hidden Variables That Change Your Number

The three archetypes above are starting points. Several real-world factors can push your requirement up or down significantly.

### 1. Your Climate Zone

Solar generation varies dramatically by location. A 10kW solar array in Phoenix, Arizona generates roughly 1,800 kWh/month. The same array in Manchester, UK generates around 700 kWh/month. This affects how quickly your battery recharges each day.

In cloudy climates, you need **more battery capacity** to bridge multiple consecutive low-generation days. In sunny climates, a smaller battery cycles more efficiently because it recharges fully each day.

### 2. Your Utility Rate Structure

If you're on a **Time-of-Use (TOU) tariff**, the optimal battery size is driven by your peak/off-peak rate differential, not just your consumption. You want enough capacity to cover your entire evening peak period without drawing from the grid.

If you have **1:1 Net Metering**, the financial case for a large battery is weaker—the grid effectively acts as free storage. In this case, size for backup only, not daily cycling.

### 3. EV Charging

Adding an electric vehicle to your home's energy profile dramatically increases storage requirements. A typical EV needs 10-15 kWh per 40 miles of daily driving. If you want to charge your EV from solar + battery rather than the grid, add this to your daily storage requirement.

For most homeowners, the practical approach is to charge the EV directly from solar during the day (using a smart charger that follows solar generation) rather than routing through the home battery. This avoids the round-trip efficiency loss and doesn't deplete your backup reserve.

### 4. Seasonal Variation

Always size for your **worst month**, not your average. In the northern hemisphere, December and January have the shortest days and lowest solar generation. A system that works perfectly in July may leave you drawing heavily from the grid in December.

Our calculator uses month-by-month solar irradiance data for your specific location to ensure your system is sized for year-round performance, not just summer.

## Modular vs Fixed Capacity Systems

One of the most important decisions when sizing is whether to buy a **fixed capacity** system or a **modular** system.

**Fixed capacity systems** (like the Tesla Powerwall) come in set sizes. If you need more storage later, you add another complete unit. This is simple but can be expensive if your needs grow.

**Modular systems** (like Enphase IQ Battery, FranklinWH, or BYD Battery-Box) allow you to add individual battery modules to increase capacity. This is ideal if you're unsure about your future needs or want to start smaller and expand as your EV or consumption grows.

**Our recommendation:** If you're uncertain, start with a modular system sized for Archetype 1 or 2, with the inverter sized for your eventual target capacity. Adding battery modules later is much cheaper than replacing the entire system.

## Common Questions (FAQ)

### Is 10kWh enough for most homes?
For daily self-consumption cycling (storing solar for evening use), 10kWh is sufficient for most 3-4 bedroom homes in the UK and US. For backup power, 10kWh covers 12-24 hours of essential loads. If you want 2+ days of backup or have an EV, you'll need 20kWh or more.

### Should I buy more battery than I need now?
Generally no—oversizing wastes capital on capacity that sits unused. However, if your inverter supports expansion, buy the right-sized inverter for your eventual goal and start with a smaller battery bank. This is the most cost-effective approach.

### How do I know if my solar array is big enough to fill the battery?
A rough rule: your solar array (in kW) should be at least equal to your battery capacity (in kWh) divided by your peak sun hours. For example, a 10kWh battery in a location with 4 peak sun hours needs at least a 2.5kW solar array to fully recharge in one day. Our [battery sizing guide](/sizing/how-to-size-solar-battery-uk-us) covers this calculation in detail.

### What if I get the size wrong?
If you buy too small, you can add more battery modules (with a modular system) or add a second battery unit. If you buy too large, you'll simply have more backup capacity than you need—not ideal financially, but not harmful to the system.
