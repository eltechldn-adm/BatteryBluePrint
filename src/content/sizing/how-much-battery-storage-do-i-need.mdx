The most common question we get isn't technical—it's practical: *"Is 10kWh enough?"*

The answer depends entirely on **why** you are buying a battery.
Are you just trying to save a few pennies on evening rates?
Are you trying to keep the lights on during a 2-hour blackout?
Or are you trying to survive a 3-day grid collapse in winter?

These three goals require vastly different battery sizes. Let’s break down the three "Archetypes" of battery buyers and the capacity they typically need.

---

## Archetype 1: The "Bill Buster" (ROI Focused)
**Goal:** Maximize financial savings. Buy low, sell high. Zero grid usage at peak times.
**Backup Priority:** Low. Used mainly for convenience.

If you are strictly focused on Return on Investment (ROI), **smaller is better.**
You want a battery that cycles 100% of its capacity every single day to tackle the "Time of Use" rates.

*   **Strategy:** Size the battery to cover *only* the peak rate window (e.g., 4 PM – 9 PM).
*   **Typical Usage:** During these 5 hours, the average efficient home might use 3–6 kWh.
*   **Recommended Size:** 5 kWh to 10 kWh.
*   **Why?** If you buy 20 kWh, you might cover the peak window and then have remaining charge left over when rates drop to "Off-Peak" cheap levels. Using stored battery power when grid power is cheap is financially inefficient.

**Verdict:** **5 - 10 kWh** is usually the ROI sweet spot for most standard homes.

## Archetype 2: The "Resilience" User (Backup Focused)
**Goal:** Keep the fridge, wifi, and lights on during occasional storms or rolling blackouts.
**Backup Priority:** Medium. Needs to last 12–24 hours.

This is the most common customer today. You aren't prepper-level, but you hate when the power goes out. You want to sleep through a blackout without the CPAP machine turning off.

*   **Strategy:** Determine "Critical Loads."
*   **Critical Load List:** Fridge (1.5 kWh/day), Wifi (0.2 kWh), LED Lights (0.5 kWh), Gas Furnace Fan (2 kWh), Minimal Kitchen use.
*   **Total Critical Need:** ~5–7 kWh per night.
*   **Recommended Size:** 13.5 kWh to 15 kWh (e.g., One Tesla Powerwall or equivalent).
*   **Why?** A 13.5 kWh battery allows you to burn 7 kWh overnight and still wake up with 50% battery remaining—perfect buffer in case the next day is cloudy and solar recharge is slow.

**Verdict:** **13 - 15 kWh** is the standard "whole home backup" size for moderate usage.

---

## Archetype 3: The "Off-Grid" / Survivor
**Goal:** Total independence. Indefinite survival during long outages or completely disconnected living.
**Backup Priority:** Extreme. Needs to survive 3 days of bad weather (autonomy).

This requires a completely different mindset. You aren't sizing for "average" days; you are sizing for the **Worst Case Scenario**.

*   **Scenario:** It’s December. It’s raining for 3 days straight. Solar production is near zero (10% of normal).
*   **Requirement:** You need 3 days of "Autonomy" (Days of storage without recharge).
*   **Math:** If you use 15 kWh/day × 3 days = 45 kWh required.
*   **Recommended Size:** 30 kWh to 50 kWh+.
*   **Why?** You need massive tanks because you cannot rely on the "pump" (solar) to refill them reliably in winter.

**Verdict:** **30 kWh+** (Multiple stacked units or large server-rack banks) is required for true independence.

## What Usually Eats Your Capacity?

People overestimate how far 10 kWh goes because they forget about the "Power Hogs." If you want to run these on battery, you need to scale up—big time.

1.  **Electric Heating (Heat Pumps/Resistive):** The biggest killer. A heat pump can pull 3-4 kW continuously. A 13.5 kWh battery will be dead in **3 hours** of heating.
2.  **EV Charging:** An electric car battery is massive (60–100 kWh). Trying to charge a car with a home battery is like trying to fill a swimming pool with a bucket. It will drain your home battery in 1 hour and only give the car ~30 miles of range.
3.  **Electric Stoves/Ovens:** Baking a turkey? That oven pulls 2-3 kW.

If you have these "Hogs" and want to back them up, you automatically move into **Archetype 3**. You need 2-3x the standard storage.

## Rules of Thumb by Home Size

While manual calculation is best, here are general averages we see in the field (USA/UK Standards):

| Home Size | ROI Focus (kWh) | Backup Focus (kWh) | Off-Grid Focus (kWh) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Small Appt / Condo** | 3.6 - 5 kWh | 5 - 10 kWh | 15+ kWh |
| **Average 3-Bed Home** | 5 - 10 kWh | 10 - 15 kWh | 30+ kWh |
| **Large Family Home** | 10 - 15 kWh | 20 - 27 kWh | 50+ kWh |
| **Large + EV + Heat Pump** | 15 - 20 kWh | 30 - 40 kWh | 80+ kWh |

## FAQ

<DocsFAQ>
    <DocsFAQItem question='Can I settle for "Critical Load" backup?'>
    Yes. This is a smart way to save money. You install a "Critical Loads Panel." When the grid dies, the battery *only* powers that panel (Fridge, Wifi, Lights). It disconnects the AC, Oven, and Dryer. This makes a small 10 kWh battery feel like a huge 20 kWh battery because you cut out the waste.
    </DocsFAQItem>

    <DocsFAQItem question="Can't I just charge my EV from the battery?">
    Technically yes, but practically no. It doesn't make sense to drain your house's emergency power just to add 10% to your car. Most smart chargers allow you to charge the EV *only* from excess solar during the day, bypassing the home battery entirely.
    </DocsFAQItem>

    <DocsFAQItem question="What if I get it wrong?">
    Start modular. Buy a system that allows expansion. Don't buy a brand that is a "closed box" integrated unit if you aren't sure. Systems like Enphase, FranklinWH, or Sol-Ark allow you to add more battery modules later without replacing the main inverter.

## Calculate Your Exact Number

Charts and averages are helpful, but your home is unique.
A 2,000 sq ft home in Arizona needs different storage than a 2,000 sq ft home in Maine.

Use our calculator to input your specific appliances and location. We'll tell you which Archetype you fit into and exactly how many kWh you need.
