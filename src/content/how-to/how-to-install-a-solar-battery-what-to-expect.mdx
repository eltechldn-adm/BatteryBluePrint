Installation day is exciting — you're about to have a battery system that will power your home through outages and cut your electricity bills. But if you've never had a battery installed before, you might not know what to expect, what to prepare, or how to tell if the job has been done correctly.

This guide walks you through the entire installation process from the day before to the day after, so you can be a confident, informed homeowner throughout.

## Before Installation Day: What to Prepare

A smooth installation starts with good preparation. Here's what to do in the days before your installer arrives.

### Clear the Installation Area

Your installer will need clear access to the installation location — typically a garage wall, utility room, or exterior wall. Remove any items stored in front of the planned location. Leave at least 1 metre of clearance in front of the battery for the installer to work safely.

If the battery is going outdoors, make sure the area is accessible and that any gates or side passages are unlocked.

### Arrange for an Adult to Be Home

Someone over 18 must be present for the entire installation. The installer will need to ask questions, get sign-offs, and walk you through the system at the end. This is not a job you can leave running while you go to work.

Most installations take 4–8 hours. Plan for a full day at home.

### Know Where Your Main Switchboard Is

The installer will need access to your main electrical switchboard (also called the consumer unit, breaker box, or distribution board). Know where it is and make sure it's accessible. If it's in a locked cupboard, have the key ready.

### Confirm the Quote Details

Before the installer arrives, re-read your quote and confirm:
- The battery brand and model being installed
- The total installed price (including any switchboard work)
- Whether permits have been obtained (ask for permit numbers if applicable)
- The warranty terms

If anything has changed since the quote was issued, discuss it before work begins — not after.

## What Happens During Installation

### Stage 1: Site Assessment and Planning (30–60 minutes)

The installer's first job is to assess the actual installation site and plan the cable routes. Even if they visited for the quote, they'll do a more detailed assessment on installation day.

They'll check:
- The condition of your switchboard and whether it needs upgrading
- The best cable route from the battery location to the switchboard
- The structural integrity of the wall where the battery will be mounted
- Whether any additional earthing or protection devices are needed

This is a good time to ask any questions you have about the process.

### Stage 2: Switchboard Work (1–3 hours)

Most battery installations require modifications to your electrical switchboard. This is the most technically complex part of the job and must be done by a licensed electrician.

Typical switchboard work includes:
- Installing a new circuit breaker for the battery
- Adding a backup circuit (if you want a dedicated backup power circuit for essential loads)
- Installing an energy meter (if not already present)
- Adding surge protection devices

If your switchboard is old or doesn't have spare capacity, it may need to be upgraded. This should have been identified at the quote stage, but occasionally surprises emerge on installation day. If the installer identifies additional work needed, get a written explanation and revised price before agreeing to proceed.

### Stage 3: Battery Mounting (30–60 minutes)

The battery unit is mounted to the wall using heavy-duty brackets. Most residential batteries weigh 50–150 kg, so this requires at least two people and appropriate lifting equipment.

The installer will:
- Mark and drill mounting holes
- Secure the mounting bracket to the wall (into studs or masonry anchors)
- Lift and attach the battery unit to the bracket
- Verify the unit is level and secure

### Stage 4: Cabling (1–2 hours)

Cables are run from the battery to the switchboard. Depending on the installation, this may involve:
- Running cables through walls or ceiling cavities
- Installing conduit for cable protection
- Connecting DC cables (if DC-coupled with solar panels)
- Connecting AC cables to the switchboard

This is often the most time-consuming part of the installation, particularly if cable routes are complex.

### Stage 5: Commissioning (30–60 minutes)

Once everything is connected, the installer commissions the system. This involves:
- Powering up the battery management system
- Connecting the battery to your home Wi-Fi (for monitoring)
- Setting up the energy management software
- Running a test charge and discharge cycle
- Verifying that backup mode works correctly (the installer may briefly cut grid power to test this)

### Stage 6: Handover and Walkthrough (30 minutes)

A professional installer will walk you through the system before leaving. They should show you:
- How to monitor the battery state of charge (via app or display)
- How to check for alerts or errors
- What to do if the system goes into fault mode
- How to contact them for support

Ask for all documentation: the installation certificate, warranty cards, and any permit paperwork.

## How to Verify the Job Was Done Correctly

You don't need to be an electrician to do a basic quality check. Here's what to look for:

**Physical installation:**
- The battery is mounted securely and level — no wobble when you push it gently
- All cables are neatly routed and protected (not hanging loose or running across walkways)
- Cable entry points are sealed (no gaps where water or pests could enter)
- The battery display or indicator lights are showing normal status

**Documentation:**
- You have a signed installation certificate
- You have the warranty documentation for the battery
- You have any permit paperwork (if applicable in your jurisdiction)
- You have the installer's contact details for support

**Functionality:**
- The monitoring app is set up and showing live data
- The battery is charging (if solar panels are present and it's daylight)
- The backup circuit works (if you had one installed) — the installer should have tested this

**What to do if something seems wrong:**
Contact the installer immediately. Don't attempt to investigate electrical issues yourself. A reputable installer will return to address any issues promptly.

## After Installation: The First Week

**Day 1:** The battery will go through its first charge cycle. Monitor the app to see it charging from solar (or from the grid if solar isn't present). This is normal and expected.

**Days 2–7:** Watch the daily charge and discharge pattern. You should see the battery charging during the day (from solar or cheap overnight rates) and discharging in the evening. If the pattern looks wrong — for example, the battery is always empty or never charges — contact your installer.

**Week 2 onwards:** Check your electricity bill after the first full billing period. You should see a reduction in grid imports. The [BatteryBlueprint calculator](/calculator) can help you estimate what reduction to expect based on your system size and usage.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to be home the whole time?**

Yes. Someone over 18 must be present throughout the installation. The installer needs access to various parts of your home and will need your sign-off at key stages.

**Q: Will the power be off during installation?**

Yes, briefly. The installer will need to isolate your main power supply to work safely on the switchboard. This typically takes 1–3 hours. Plan accordingly — charge your phone, have a torch handy, and don't schedule anything that requires power during this window.

**Q: What if the installer finds additional work is needed?**

Get a written explanation and revised price before agreeing to any additional work. Legitimate additional work does occur (old switchboards, unexpected cable routing challenges), but you should understand exactly what's needed and why before authorising it.

**Q: How long will the battery last before needing replacement?**

Quality lithium batteries are warranted for 10 years and typically last 12–15 years before capacity degrades significantly. At end of life, the battery can usually be replaced without replacing the inverter or other system components.

**Q: What maintenance does a solar battery need?**

Very little. Lithium batteries are essentially maintenance-free. Keep the area around the battery clear, check the monitoring app periodically for alerts, and have the system inspected by a qualified electrician every 5 years or if you notice any issues. For a full breakdown of ongoing costs and what to budget for over the battery's lifetime, see our [solar battery cost guide](/cost/solar-battery-cost-uk-2026).

**Q: What should I do if the battery makes a noise or smells unusual?**

A faint hum from the inverter is normal. Any unusual sounds (clicking, buzzing, hissing) or smells (burning, chemical) are not normal. If you notice these, switch off the battery using the isolator switch (your installer will show you where this is) and contact your installer immediately. Do not attempt to investigate the battery yourself. Lithium batteries are very safe under normal conditions, but any sign of abnormal operation should be taken seriously.

**Q: How do I know if my installation was done to code?**

A properly certified installation will come with an Electrical Installation Certificate (UK), a permit sign-off (US), or an installation compliance certificate (Australia). If your installer didn't provide these documents, ask for them. In the UK, you can also check that the installation has been registered with your local building control authority — MCS-certified installers are required to do this automatically.
