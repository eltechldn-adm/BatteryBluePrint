You've installed a solar battery. Now what? Many homeowners are surprised to discover that simply having a battery doesn't automatically maximise savings — the way you configure and use it makes a significant difference to your financial return.

This guide covers the practical strategies that actually move the needle on your electricity bills, from choosing the right electricity tariff to shifting your biggest loads to the cheapest hours.

<!--CTA:how-to-->

## Strategy 1: Choose the Right Electricity Tariff

This is the single highest-impact decision you can make after installation. Your electricity tariff determines when electricity is cheap and when it's expensive — and your battery's job is to exploit that difference.

### Time-of-Use (TOU) Tariffs

A time-of-use tariff charges different rates at different times of day. Typically:
- **Peak hours** (e.g., 4pm–9pm): Expensive — often 2–3× the off-peak rate
- **Off-peak hours** (e.g., 11pm–7am): Cheap — sometimes as low as 5–7p/kWh in the UK or $0.05/kWh in the US
- **Shoulder hours** (everything else): Medium price

With a battery, the strategy is simple: charge the battery during off-peak hours (cheap electricity) and discharge it during peak hours (expensive electricity). The difference between the rates is your profit per kWh.

**Example:** If off-peak electricity costs £0.07/kWh and peak costs £0.28/kWh, and your battery can store 10 kWh, you save £2.10 per full cycle (10 × £0.21). At one cycle per day, that's £766 per year from tariff arbitrage alone — before counting any solar generation.

### Export Tariffs

If you have solar panels, you can also earn money by exporting excess generation to the grid. In the UK, the Smart Export Guarantee (SEG) pays you for every kWh you export. In the US, net metering credits work similarly.

With a battery, the strategy is to:
1. Use solar generation to power your home first
2. Store any excess in the battery
3. Only export to the grid once the battery is full

This maximises the value of your solar generation by using it yourself (at retail electricity prices) rather than exporting it (at lower export rates).

### Which Tariff Is Right for You?

The best tariff depends on your battery size, solar generation, and usage patterns. As a general guide:
- **Battery only (no solar):** A TOU tariff with a large peak/off-peak price difference maximises arbitrage savings
- **Solar + battery:** A TOU tariff combined with a good export rate maximises total value
- **Off-grid or backup priority:** Tariff optimisation is less relevant — focus on reliability

Ask your energy supplier what tariffs are available for battery owners. Many suppliers now offer battery-specific tariffs with very cheap overnight rates.

## Strategy 2: Configure Your Battery's Charge Schedule

Most modern batteries allow you to set a charge schedule — specific times when the battery will charge from the grid. This is essential for TOU tariff optimisation.

Without a schedule, your battery might charge from the grid at peak rates (expensive) or discharge when it should be storing cheap overnight electricity. A properly configured schedule ensures the battery charges only during cheap hours.

**How to set it up:**
1. Open your battery's monitoring app (Tesla app, BYD app, Enphase Enlighten, etc.)
2. Find the "Schedule" or "Time-of-Use" settings
3. Set the battery to charge during your off-peak window
4. Set the battery to discharge during your peak window
5. Set a minimum state of charge (typically 20%) to preserve battery life

The exact steps vary by battery brand. Consult your battery's user manual or the manufacturer's support resources.

## Strategy 3: Shift Your Biggest Loads

Your battery stores energy, but it can't create it. The more efficiently you use the energy in the battery, the further it goes.

**Load shifting** means running high-energy appliances during cheap hours (when the battery is charging or solar is generating) rather than during expensive hours.

The biggest opportunities are typically:
- **Washing machine:** Run during the day (solar) or overnight (cheap rate). A typical wash uses 0.5–2 kWh.
- **Tumble dryer:** Run during the day (solar) or overnight. Uses 2–4 kWh per cycle.
- **Dishwasher:** Run overnight or during the day. Uses 1–2 kWh per cycle.
- **EV charging:** Schedule to charge overnight during cheap hours. A typical EV needs 10–30 kWh per charge.
- **Immersion heater / hot water:** Heat water during the day from solar. Uses 2–4 kWh.

**The rule of thumb:** If an appliance has a timer, use it. Set it to run during your cheapest hours. This reduces the load on your battery during peak hours, making the stored energy go further.

## Strategy 4: Optimise Your Solar Self-Consumption

If you have solar panels, your goal is to use as much of your own solar generation as possible — rather than exporting it to the grid at a lower rate.

**Self-consumption rate** is the percentage of your solar generation that you use yourself (either directly or via the battery). A self-consumption rate of 80%+ is excellent. Below 50% suggests you're exporting too much.

To improve self-consumption:
- **Size the battery correctly:** A battery that's too small will fill up quickly and force excess solar to be exported. Use the [BatteryBlueprint calculator](/calculator) to check whether your battery is appropriately sized for your solar generation.
- **Shift loads to solar hours:** Run appliances during the day when solar is generating.
- **Use smart plugs and scheduling:** Automate load shifting so you don't have to think about it.
- **Consider a hot water diverter:** A solar diverter (like the iBoost or Eddi) automatically sends excess solar to your hot water cylinder before it would otherwise be exported. This is one of the highest-value uses of excess solar.

## Strategy 5: Monitor and Adjust

The biggest mistake battery owners make is setting up the system and never looking at it again. Regular monitoring lets you catch problems early and identify optimisation opportunities.

**What to monitor weekly:**
- Daily charge and discharge cycles — is the battery cycling as expected?
- Self-consumption rate — are you using your solar generation efficiently?
- Grid import during peak hours — is the battery discharging when it should be?
- Battery state of charge at key times — is it full by the end of the solar day? Empty by morning?

**What to check monthly:**
- Electricity bill — is your grid import reducing as expected?
- Export earnings (if applicable) — are you being paid for your exports?
- Battery health — most apps show a health or capacity indicator

**When to contact your installer:**
- The battery isn't charging or discharging as scheduled
- The monitoring app shows persistent errors or alerts
- Your electricity bill hasn't reduced after 2–3 months

## Strategy 6: Understand Your Battery's Limitations

Knowing what your battery can't do is as important as knowing what it can do.

**It can't power everything indefinitely.** A 10 kWh battery powering a 2 kWh average load will last 5 hours. If you have a 5 kW electric oven running, it'll last 2 hours. Size your expectations to your battery capacity.

**Cold weather reduces performance.** Lithium batteries charge and discharge less efficiently in cold temperatures. In winter, your battery may deliver slightly less usable energy than in summer. This is normal — not a fault.

**Depth of discharge limits protect the battery.** Most batteries are configured to maintain a minimum state of charge (typically 10–20%) to protect battery longevity. This means you can't use 100% of the nameplate capacity. The [battery sizing guide](/sizing/how-much-battery-storage-do-i-need) explains how to account for this in your calculations.

**Simultaneous high loads may exceed the battery's power output.** If you try to run a 3 kW oven, a 2 kW kettle, and a 1.5 kW microwave simultaneously (6.5 kW total), and your battery's continuous power output is 5 kW, the battery will struggle. Either the battery will shut down or the grid will supplement. Plan your simultaneous loads accordingly.

## FAQ

**Q: How much can I realistically save with a solar battery?**

This varies enormously by location, tariff, system size, and usage patterns. In the UK, a well-optimised 10 kWh battery on a TOU tariff can save £600–£1,200 per year. In the US, savings of $500–$1,000 per year are typical for a 10 kWh system. Our [is solar battery storage worth it](/cost/is-solar-battery-storage-worth-it) guide has detailed financial analysis.

**Q: Should I always keep the battery fully charged?**

Not necessarily. If you're on a TOU tariff, you want the battery to be empty (or at minimum charge) at the start of the cheap overnight window so it can fill up with cheap electricity. If you have solar panels, you want the battery to be empty at sunrise so it can fill up with free solar energy. A full battery at the wrong time is a missed opportunity.

**Q: Does using the battery more often wear it out faster?**

Lithium batteries degrade based on the number of charge/discharge cycles and the depth of each cycle. Daily cycling at 80% depth of discharge is within the design parameters of quality batteries and won't significantly accelerate degradation. Avoid regularly discharging to 0% or charging to 100% if your battery management system allows you to set limits.

**Q: What's the best battery monitoring app?**

This depends on your battery brand. Tesla Powerwall owners use the Tesla app. Enphase owners use Enlighten. BYD owners use the BYD app. Third-party monitoring platforms like Home Assistant or SolarEdge can aggregate data from multiple sources if you have a complex system.

**Q: Can I control my battery remotely?**

Yes — all modern residential batteries include remote monitoring and control via a smartphone app. You can check the state of charge, adjust schedules, and receive alerts from anywhere with an internet connection.
