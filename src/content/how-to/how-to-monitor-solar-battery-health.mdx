You wouldn't drive a car specifically without an odometer. You wouldn't buy a used iPhone without checking the "Battery Health" percentage.
Yet, thousands of homeowners install $15,000 solar batteries and have no idea how much "life" is left in them.

Batteries are consumable assets. Like the tires on your car, they wear out physically every time you use them. This is called **Cell Degradation**.
Most monitoring apps (Tesla, Enphase, SolarEdge) show you the "State of Charge" (Fuel Gauge), but they intentionally hide the "State of Health" (Engine Condition).

Why? Because manufacturers don't want you to panic when you see 98% capacity after one month. They assume you don't understand the chemistry.

This guide pulls back the curtain. We will explain exactly how to find your battery's true health metrics, how to perform a manual capacity test that stands up in court, and how to know if you are eligible for a free warranty replacement.

## Part 1: The Two Metrics You Must Know

To monitor health, you must stop looking at the percentage on your home screen. That is just the fuel gauge.

### 1. State of Charge (SoC)
*   **Definition**: How full the tank is right now.
*   **Range**: 0% to 100%.
*   **What it tells you**: "Can I run my microwave tonight?"
*   **Analogy**: The gas needle in your car.
*   **Deceptive Factor**: A battery with 50% health can still be charged to "100% SoC." It just holds half as much energy.

### 2. State of Health (SoH)
*   **Definition**: The size of the tank compared to when it was new.
*   **Range**: 100% (New) -> 70% (Warranty Replacement) -> 0% (Dead).
*   **What it tells you**: "Did I get what I paid for?"
*   **Analogy**: The odometer or total engine wear.

**The Scary Math**:
A 10 kWh battery with 80% SoH acts like an 8 kWh battery. It still charges to "100%," but that "100%" represents significantly less electrons.

## Part 2: Expected Degradation (The "Normal" Curve)

Before you panic, you need to know what is normal. All lithium batteries degrade. It is a chemical reality of ions getting trapped in the anode (SEI Layer growth).

### The "Bathtub" Curve
Battery degradation is not a straight line. It follows a predictable curve.
1.  **The Drop (Year 1)**: You might lose 2–3% capacity in the first 6 months as the "Solid Electrolyte Interphase" (SEI) layer forms. This is healthy and expected.
2.  **The Plateau (Years 2–10)**: Degradation slows to a crawl (maybe 1% per year). This is the "sweet spot" of the battery's life.
3.  **The Knee (End of Life)**: Eventually, internal resistance spikes, and capacity plummets. This usually happens after 15+ years.

### Degradation by Chemistry (2026 Data)

| Battery Brand | Chemistry | Est. Year 1 Drop | Est. Annual Drop | 10-Year Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tesla Powerwall 2** | NMC (Nickel) | ~3.0% | ~1.5% | **83%** |
| **Tesla Powerwall 3** | LFP (Iron) | ~1.5% | ~1.0% | **88%** |
| **Enphase IQ 5P** | LFP (Iron) | ~1.5% | ~0.8% | **90%** |
| **LG Chem RESU** | NMC (Nickel) | ~4.0% | ~2.5% | **75%** |
| **FranklinWH** | LFP (Iron) | ~1.5% | ~1.0% | **88%** |

*Note: These are engineering estimates based on cycle life data. Your mileage may vary based on heat and usage.*

## Part 3: How to Find Your SoH (Brand by Brand)

Manufacturers hide this data deep in the menus. Here is how to find it.

### Tesla Powerwall
Tesla does not show SoH in the basic consumer settings.
*   **Method A (The App)**: Go to **Settings** > **My Home Info**. Sometimes it lists "Energy Capacity." If it says 13.5 kWh, it's just the spec sheet. If it says 12.8 kWh, that's live data.
*   **Method B (The Gateway)**: If you connect to the Gateway's local WiFi (TEG-xxx) and log in as "Customer" (email on back of unit), you can see the raw diagnostic strings. Look for `nominal_full_pack_energy`.
*   **Method C (Export Data)**: Download your CSV data. Sum up the "Discharge Energy" column for a full year. If it is dropping faster than 2%, you have a problem.

### Enphase (Enlighten)
Enphase provides excellent granularity if you know where to look.
*   **Method**: Open Enlighten App > **Menu** > **System** > **Devices** > **Battery**.
*   **Detail**: It lists the "Charge Cycles" count.
*   **Secret**: Enphase batteries are modular. If your capacity drops by exactly 33%, it means one of the three microinverters inside the unit has failed, not the chemistry.

### SolarEdge (SetApp)
SolarEdge is transparent.
*   **Method**: Log into the Monitoring Platform (web desktop version). Go to **Layout** > Right-click the battery icon > **Information**. It usually lists "SOH: 94%" explicitly.

## Part 4: The DIY Capacity Test (The Only Truth)

Do not trust the software. Software lies (or estimates). To know the truth, you must physically measure the energy leaving the box.

**Warning**: This takes 24 hours and requires you to manipulate your breakers.

### Step 1: Force Charge to 100%
*   Set your "Backup Reserve" to 100%.
*   Allow the battery to charge fully from solar or grid until it stops taking power.
*   Wait 2 hours for the cells to "balance" (top off).

### Step 2: The Discharge
*   Wait for the sun to go down (so solar doesn't interfere).
*   Go to your breaker panel. Turn **OFF** the solar PV breaker.
*   Set your "Backup Reserve" to 0% (Self-Powered Mode).
*   Turn on high loads (AC, Dryer, Oven) to create a steady draw (e.g., 3-5 kW).
*   Watch the app until the battery hits 0% and stops discharging.

### Step 3: The Math
*   Open the app's "Energy impact" graph.
*   Look at the "Discharged" total for that specific time period.
*   **Formula**: (Discharged kWh) / (Nameplate kWh) = **SoH**.
*   **Example**: You discharged **11.2 kWh** from a **13.5 kWh** Powerwall.
    *   `11.2 / 13.5 = 0.829` (83% SoH).

## Part 5: When to File a Warranty Claim

Most warranties have a "70% retention guarantee" for 10 years.
If your DIY test shows **68%**, you theoretically have a claim.

**However, read the fine print.**
1.  **Throughput Clause**: Some warranties expire after a certain amount of energy (e.g., "37 MWh of throughput") regardless of years. If you participate in VPPs every day, you might hit the throughput limit in Year 8.
2.  **Temperature Clause**: If the logs show the battery was exposed to >122°F (ambient temperature), they can deny the claim. This is common for batteries installed on south-facing walls in Arizona.
3.  **Connection Clause**: If the battery was offline (no internet) for >6 months, the warranty is often voided because they couldn't push firmware updates to protect the cells.

### The Script: How to Talk to Support
When you call Tesla or Enphase, do not say "It feels weak." Say this:
*"I performed a controlled capacity test on [Date]. From 100% to 0% SoC, the unit only discharged 8.4 kWh. This represents 62% of rated capacity, which is below the 70% threshold in my Warranty Agreement. Please open a Tier 2 ticket for a log review."*

## Glossary of Terms

*   **Cycles**: One full discharge from 100% to 0% (or equivalent, e.g., two 50% discharges).
*   **BMS (Battery Management System)**: The computer inside the battery that balances voltage.
*   **Internal Resistance (IR)**: The friction inside the battery to electron flow. High IR = Heat = Degradation.
*   **Depth of Discharge (DoD)**: How much of the battery you use. Using only the middle 50% makes it last longer.

      Generally, no. Home batteries have a C-rate (discharge speed) of roughly 0.5C (5kW output for a 13.5kWh battery). This is very gentle. In comparison, charging an EV at a Supercharger hits the battery at 3C or 4C. You cannot "fast charge" a home battery hard enough to damage it under normal wiring.

      Lithium ions move slower in the cold. A cold battery has higher internal resistance, which looks like lower capacity to the BMS. If your battery shows 90% in July and 85% in January, that is likely just **temp-derating**, not permanent degradation. Wait for spring before panicking.

      Modern packs are made of modules. If one cell group fails, the BMS will isolate it. You might see a sudden drop in capacity (e.g., 100% -> 80%), but the unit keeps working. This is a clear warranty case—manufacturers can often replace just the bad module rather than the whole unit.

      No. The SOH reading is calculated based on voltage physics, not a simple counter. It is a measurement of the chemical capability of the cell. You cannot "reset" chemistry. If the number is low, the battery is physically degraded.

## Reference: Voltage vs SoC Table (48V System)

If you are using a voltmeter, use this table to estimate your battery's charge. Note the difference between NMC (Tesla Powerwall 2) and LFP (Powerwall 3 / Enphase).

| State of Charge | NMC Voltage (48V Nominal) | LFP Voltage (51.2V Nominal) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **100% (Full)** | 57.6V | 58.4V |
| **90%** | 56.5V | 53.6V (Surface Charge) |
| **70%** | 54.0V | 53.2V |
| **50%** | 51.5V | 52.9V (Flat Curve) |
| **30%** | 49.0V | 52.5V |
| **10% (Empty)** | 46.5V | 51.0V |
| **0% (Cutoff)** | 42.0V | 48.0V (Steep Drop) |

*   **Warning**: LFP batteries have a very flat voltage curve. It is almost impossible to guess SoC between 30% and 70% using voltage alone. You must rely on the BMS "Coulomb Counting."
