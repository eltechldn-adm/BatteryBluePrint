The solar industry is currently in a "Gold Rush" phase. And like any gold rush, it has attracted legitimate engineers, but also an army of scammers, fly-by-night salespeople, and unqualified contractors looking for a quick payout.

A solar battery is a high-voltage electrical appliance. It is not a refrigerator. If installed incorrectly, it can cause arc faults, void your manufacturer warranty, or simply fail to turn on when the grid goes down.

Before you sign a $30,000 contract, you need to verify that your installer is qualified. Do not take their word for it. Do not trust the logo on their polo shirt.

Here is the comprehensive engineering process to vet any solar company in 5 minutes, plus a Deep Dive into reading the fine print of your contract.

## Part 1: The Gold Standard (NABCEP)

The **North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP)** is the PhD of solar. It is voluntary, difficult to get, and requires documented experience.

*   **The Credential**: Look for **"PV Installation Professional" (PVIP)**. This is the highest standard.
*   **The Salesguy Myth**: Your salesperson does *not* need to be NABCEP certified. They are sales. But the **Lead Installer** or **Project Manager** must be.
*   **How to Verify**:
    1.  Go to [NABCEP.org](https://www.nabcep.org).
    2.  Click "Professional Directory."
    3.  Search by the installer's last name or company.
    4.  **No result?** Ask them: "Who is the NABCEP certified pro on your team?" If they say "We don't need that," hang up.

## Part 2: State Contractor License (Mandatory)

In almost every state, you cannot legally install a battery without an electrical license.

### California
*   **License Required**: **C-10 (Electrical)**.
*   **Can they use C-46 (Solar)?**: Yes, but only if the battery is part of a solar system. A C-10 is preferred for standalone storage.
*   **Lookup Tool**: [CSLB Website](https://www.cslb.ca.gov).
*   **Check Status**: Must say **"ACTIVE"**.
*   **Check Bond**: Must say **"Bonded"**.
*   **Check Workers Comp**: If they are "Exempt," they are likely using illegal off-books labor. **Do not hire.**

### Texas
*   **License Required**: **TECL (Texas Electrical Contractor License)**.
*   **Lookup Tool**: [TDLR Website](https://www.tdlr.texas.gov).
*   **Rule**: The TECL number must be displayed on their truck and contract (e.g., TECL #12345).

### Florida
*   **License Required**: **CVC (Certified Solar Contractor)** or **EC (Certified Electrical Contractor)**.
*   **Lookup Tool**: [DBPR Website](https://www.myfloridalicense.com).

## Part 3: Manufacturer Certifications (The "Badge")

Batteries are walled gardens. You cannot just buy a Tesla Powerwall on eBay and wire it up. You need proprietary commissioning software to activate it.
If an unauthorized electrician installs a Powerwall, **the warranty is void specifically.**

*   **Tesla**: Look for "Tesla Certified Installer."
    *   *Verify*: Go to Tesla.com/support/certified-installers.
*   **Enphase**: Look for "Platinum," "Gold," or "Silver" badges.
    *   *Verify*: Enphase.com/installer-locator.
*   **FranklinWH**: "FranklinWH Certified."

**Pro Tip**: "Authorized Dealer" implies they can *sell* it. "Certified Installer" implies they have been *trained* to install it. Always verify the latter.

---

## Part 4: Contract Red Flags (The Fine Print)

You found a licensed installer. Now look at the contract. If you see these clauses, do not sign.

### 1. The "Escalator Clause"
*   **The Text**: "Utility rates increase by 4% per year, so your lease payment will increase by 2.9% per year."
*   **The Trap**: A 2.9% compounding increase means your payment doubles in 25 years.
*   **The Fix**: Demand a **0% Escalator** (Fixed Payment).

### 2. The "Arbitration Only" Clause
*   **The Text**: "Customer waives the right to a jury trial and class action lawsuit."
*   **The Trap**: If they burn your house down, you can't sue them in open court. You have to go to a private arbitrator (who is often friendly to the company).
*   **The Fix**: Strike this out or find a local installer who stands by their work.

### 3. "Equipment Substitution"
*   **The Text**: "Installer reserves the right to substitute equipment of equal or greater value."
*   **The Trap**: You bought a premium **Enphase** system. They show up with a generic Chinese string inverter because "supply chain issues."
*   **The Fix**: Add an addendum: *"Any equipment substitution requires written Customer approval."*

---

## Part 5: The "Lien Waiver" (Crucial Protection)

This is the most boring but important document in construction.
*   **The Scenario**: You pay your installer $20,000. The installer *forgets* to pay the battery distributor (CED or Greentech).
*   **The Consequence**: The distributor puts a **Mechanic's Lien** on *your house*. You have to pay twice to remove it.
*   **The Fix**: Before making the final payment, demand an "Unconditional Lien Waiver" proving that all suppliers have been paid.

---

## Part 6: Change Orders

Construction is messy. Sometimes the main panel is too old and needs an upgrade ($3,000).
*   **The Rule**: Never accept a verbal change order.
*   **The Process**:
    1.  Installer identifies an issue (e.g., "We need to trench 50 feet").
    2.  Installer writes a "Change Order" document listing the exact cost.
    3.  You sign it.
    4.  *Then* work proceeds.
*   **Red Flag**: An invoice at the end of the job for "Extra Work" that you never signed for.

      A Broker (like EnergySage or a local consultant) connects you with installers but doesn't do the work. This is fine, provided the **contract** is signed with the actual licensed installation company, not the broker. If the broker disappears, you need to know who to call for warranty work.

      It is a lagging indicator. A company can have an A+ rating and still be terrible if they just pay to resolve complaints quickly. Use it to check for *patterns*. If you see 5 reviews mentioning "roof leaks" in the last month, that is a pattern.

      Most solar contracts include a "Production Guarantee" (e.g., 10,000 kWh per year). If the system underperforms, they pay you the difference. Check if this guarantee includes a "True-Up Payment" in cash, or just a credit towards future service. Cash is king.

## Deep Dive: Insurance Requirements (What to Ask For)

A "license" allows them directly to work. "Insurance" protects you if they burn your house down.
Do not accept a simple "We are insured." Demand the **COI (Certificate of Insurance)**.

### 1. General Liability
*   **Minimum**: $1,000,000 per occurrence.
*   **Purpose**: If they drop a battery on your foot or crash their truck into your garage.

### 2. Workers Compensation
*   **Minimum**: Statutory Limits.
*   **Purpose**: If an installer falls off your roof, they sue their boss, not you.
*   **Red Flag**: If they claim "Exempt" status, they are often using 1099 independent contractors. If one of those contractors gets hurt, YOU are liable.

### 3. Professional Liability (Errors & Omissions)
*   **Minimum**: $1,000,000.
*   **Purpose**: If they design the system wrong (undersized wire) and it causes a fire 3 years later. This is different from General Liability. Most cheap installers skip this.

## The Reference Check: 3 Questions to Ask

Don't just ask "Were they good?" That is too vague. Call a past customer (ask the installer for 3 phone numbers) and ask these specific questions:

1.  **"Did they pass the final inspection on the first try?"**
    *   *Why*: If they failed inspection, it means they don't know the local code. Multiple failures can delay your PTO (Permission to Operate) by months.
2.  **"Did the final invoice match the initial quote exactly?"**
    *   *Why*: This reveals if they use "bait and switch" tactics or hit you with surprise "Change Orders" for trenching or panel upgrades.
3.  **"Have you had to call them for service? Did they answer?"**
    *   *Why*: Every battery has glitches. You need to know if they ghost you after they get the check.
