Solar batteries are remarkably reliable pieces of hardware. They have no moving parts (other than cooling fans) and are designed to sit quietly in your garage for 15 years.

But when they do fail, they tend to fail in confusing ways.
You open your app and see "System Offline."
Or "Status: Standby" when it should be charging.
Or a blinking red light on the inverter that looks like a warning from a sci-fi movie.

When this happens, don't panic. 90% of battery issues are simple **software glitches** or **network disconnects** that you can fix yourself in 5 minutes without tools.

This guide covers the most common troubleshooting steps for Tesla Powerwall, Enphase, SolarEdge, FranklinWH, and LG Chem. We will walk you through the "Hard Reset" procedure that fixes almost everything.

## Part 1: Top 3 Most Common Symptoms

### Symptom 1: "System Offline" (No Data)
This is the #1 complaint in the industry.
*   **The Look**: The app says "Offline" or "Last updated: 3 days ago."
*   **The Reality**: Your battery is likely working fine. It is charging and discharging perfectly based on its last saved settings. It just lost its connection to the internet, so it can't tell your phone what it's doing.
*   **The Fix**: You need to reconnect the Gateway to your WiFi. (See Part 3 below).

### Symptom 2: Battery Won't Discharge at Night
*   **The Look**: It is 8 PM. You have 100% battery. But your house is pulling power from the grid.
*   **The Cause**: Your **Reserve Limit** is set too high.
*   **The Fix**:
    1.  Open App Settings.
    2.  Check "Backup Reserve" (Tesla) or "Battery Reservation" (Enphase).
    3.  If it is set to 100%, the battery is saving *all* its energy for a blackout. Lower it to 20%.

### Symptom 3: Battery Won't Charge (Stuck at 0%)
*   **The Look**: It is noon. Solar is producing. But the battery sits at 0%.
*   **The Cause**: "Storm Watch" mode OR "Deep Sleep."
*   **The Fix**: Check if there is an active severe weather alert. If not, the battery might have drained too low and entered "Sleep Mode" to protect itself. It needs a "Jump Start" from the grid. Leave the AC breaker ON for 24 hours.

## Part 2: Decoding Error Codes (Brand by Brand)

Every manufacturer uses different language for the same problems.

### Tesla Powerwall Light Codes
On the right side of the unit, there is a glowing LED strip.
*   **Solid Green**: Working perfectly.
*   **Pulsing Green**: Charging or Discharging.
*   **Rapid Flashing Green**: Downloading firmware. Do not touch.
*   **Solid Red**: Fault. Call support.
*   **No Light**: Power is out, or the LED is broken. (Check the app).

### Enphase IQ Battery LED Status
*   **Flashing Green**: Normal operation.
*   **Solid Amber**: Not commissioned (Installer error).
*   **Red Flashing**: Operational fault.
*   **Red Solid**: Critical failure.

### SolarEdge Energy Bank
*   **Blue**: Communicating.
*   **Green**: Charging/Discharging.
*   **Red**: System Error (check SetApp for code).

## Part 3: Connectivity Troubleshooting (The "Offline" Fix)

If your battery is offline, it is usually because you changed your WiFi router or password.

### How to Reconnect a Tesla Powerwall
1.  **Locate the Gateway**: It's the small white box near your main electrical panel.
2.  **Toggle Power**: Turn off the switch on the unit. Wait 60 seconds. Turn it on.
3.  **Connect to TEG WiFi**: Go to your phone's WiFi settings. Look for a network named **"TEG-XXX"**.
4.  **Password**: The password is on the sticker inside the Gateway door (labeled "GTW" or "Password").
5.  **Configure**: Once connected, open a browser to `192.168.91.1`. Follow the prompts to select your home WiFi network and enter the new password.

### How to Reconnect Enphase (Envoy)
1.  **Locate the Combiner Box**: The gray box on the wall. Open the door.
2.  **Press AP Mode**: Press the black button on the Envoy unit (little black box inside). A green light will appear next to the phone icon.
3.  **App Setup**: Open the Enlighten App. Go to **Menu** > **System** > **Devices** > **Gateway**. Tap "Reconnect WiFi."

### How to Reconnect FranklinWH
1.  **Locate the aGate**: The smart screen on your wall.
2.  **Touchscreen**: Tap the screen to wake it up.
3.  **Menu**: Go to Settings > Network > WiFi.
4.  **Connect**: Select your new network and type the password directly on the screen. (This is why we love FranklinWH—it has a screen!).

## Part 4: The "Hard Reset" (Power Cycle)

If the app is buggy, the data is lagging, or the battery is behaving weirdly, a full power cycle often clears the "digital cobwebs."

**Follow this order exactly to avoid damage.**

### Step 1: Turn EVERYTHING Off
1.  **Turn off the System Switch**: On the side of the battery (Tesla) or the rotary dial (Enphase).
2.  **Turn off the AC Breaker**: In your main electrical panel, flip the breakers labeled "Solar" and "Storage" to OFF.
3.  **Turn off the DC Isolator**: Usually a red/yellow rotary switch near the inverter.

### Step 2: The Wait
Wait fully **5 minutes**. Solar inverters have large capacitors that hold charge. They need time to discharge completely.

### Step 3: Turn EVERYTHING On (Reverse Order)
1.  **Turn on DC Isolator**.
2.  **Turn on AC Breakers** (Solar and Storage).
3.  **Turn on System Switch** (Battery).

### Step 4: The Boot Up
Do not panic if it doesn't work immediately. It takes **10–15 minutes** for the system to reboot, connect to WiFi, sync with the server, and start showing data again.

## Part 5: Advanced Diagnostics (Isolation Faults)

This is for the advanced user. If your inverter shows **"ISO Fault"** or **"Ground Fault"**, it means electricity is leaking where it shouldn't.

*   **Cause**: Usually water ingress. Rain got into a conduit, or a wire was nicked by a screw.
*   **The Test**:
    1.  Turn off the system.
    2.  Wait for a dry day.
    3.  Turn it back on.
    4.  If the fault clears, it's moisture (a loose seal). If the fault remains, it's a permanent wire damage.
*   **Action**: Call your installer. This is a fire risk.

## Part 6: Router Configuration (Port Forwarding)

Sometimes, firewall settings block the battery from talking to the server.
Ensure these ports are OPEN on your router:
*   **Port 80 / 443**: HTTP/HTTPS (Web traffic).
*   **Port 123**: NTP (Time sync).
*   **Port 53**: DNS.
*   **Port 8883**: MQTT (Tesla/Enphase secure data stream).

      Most solar batteries are set to *only* charge from solar to maximize tax credits. However, if "Storm Watch" is triggered (weather alert), the battery will panic-charge from the grid to ensure you are safe. Also, in winter, some maintenance modes draw small amounts of grid power to keep the battery warm.

## Deep Dive: How to Force a Firmware Update

Sometimes the battery is buggy because it is running code from 2023. If the "Auto-Update" is stuck, try this.

### Tesla Gateway
1.  Toggle the "System Switch" on the side of the unit OFF for 5 minutes.
2.  Turn it ON.
3.  The system will reconnect to WiFi and immediately "Check for Updates" as part of its boot sequence. This often forces a download that was stuck.

### Enphase Envoy
1.  Press the "AP Mode" button (black button) on the Envoy.
2.  Connect your phone to the "Envoy_XXXX" WiFi network.
3.  Open the **Enphase Installer Toolkit** app (you can download it as a homeowner).
4.  It will connect and say "Firmware Update Available." Tap **Update Now**.

## Still Stuck?

If a power cycle didn't fix it, you likely have a hardware fault. Before calling a tech, verify the warranty status.
